["REPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS Reproduction is an important biological process by which an organism gives rise to another organism similar to itself. • Reproduction enables the continuity of the species generation after generation. It results in formation of genetic variation. This genetic variation is inherited during reproduction. • Reproduction involving a single parent is called asexual . • Reproduction involving two parents of opposite sexes with the fusion of male and female gametes is called sexual reproduction . ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION • In asexual reproduction, only a single parent is involved in producing offspring. As a result, the off-spring produced are identical to each another as well as to the parent. • Asexual reproduction is common among single celled organisms, and in plants and animals with relatively simple organizations. It is also seen in multi cellular organisms . ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN ANIMALS The most common modes of asexual reproduction seen in animals are as follows 1. Fission • This method is observed in the members of Protista and Monera. In fission, the division of the nucleus occurs first which is then followed by the division of the cytoplasm. Subsequently, the mother cell splits into two equal sized daughter cells. • When the cytoplasmic division occurs in any direction (e.g. amoeba) the fission is called simple binary fission. 1 CHAPTER 1 ","• When cytoplasm divides along the transverse axis of the individual the fission is termed transverse binary fission. E.g. Paramecium and Planaria . • When the cytoplasm divides the longitudinal axis of the individual it is designated as longitudinal binary fission . E.g. Euglena and Vorticells . • Binary fission involves mitosis only and consequently the resultant offspring are genetically identical to the parent and to each other. • In some cases the nucleus divides several times by amitotic divisions. This leads to the formation of multiple new copies of nuclei. Cytoplasmic division does not occur during this period. The cytoplasm collects around each nucleus. Thus from a single cell many unicellular and uni-nucleated offspring are formed. This method of reproduction is called multiple fission . E.g. Amoeba and Paramecium . 2 ","Differences between binary and multiple fission- 2. Sporulation • Sporulation occurs during unfavorable conditions. Organisms like Amoeba withdraw their pseudopodia and become round in shape. They create a protective and hard three layered cyst around themselves. This process is called encystations . • Under favorable conditions, the nucleus of encysted Amoeba undergoes multiple divisions to form large number of Amoeba. These structures are called pseudo-podiospores . This process is called sporulation . The cyst then ruptures to release all new Amoebae. In Plasmodium this process occurs at a specific stage in its life cycle. 3. Budding • In this method cells of some parts of the body of the animal undergo repeated mitotic cell divisions. This leads to the formation of overgrown regions of cell masses. Such regions of cell masses that result due to mitosis are called bud . A young animal is developed from such a bud. It detaches itself from the parent body and lives as independent animal. • Such a bud produced on the outside of the body, is called exogenous budding . E.g. Hydra • Enveloped cell mass developed towards the inside of the body are called as internal buds or gemmules. Such gemmules can be seen in fresh water sponge (e.g. Spongilla ) and marine sponge (e.g . Sycon ). Each gemmule gives rise to a new animal. This is called endogenous budding . 3 ","4. Fragmentation • In this method of reproduction, the body becomes fragmented into several different parts. Each part develops the remaining body parts and becomes a complete animal. This capacity is known as regeneration . E.g. Planaria, Hydra , Starfish, etc. ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS The commonly observed modes of asexual reproduction in plants are: 1. Fission • It is the simplest of all asexual methods. It is commonly found in algae, fungi and monera (bacteria). In this process, the unicellular mother cells divides mitotically to form two daughter cells that are identical to each other as well as the mother cell. Each daughter cell eventually grows into an independent organism. 4 ","2. Buds • Some algae produce adventitious branches (e.g. Dictyota, Fucus ) or buds (e.g. Protosiphon ). Fungus like yeast produces buds. These structures are a result of unequal division and are attached to the parental cell. They eventually get separated and mature into a new organism. 3. Fragmentation • The vegetative thallus or hyphae break up into small segments due to mechanical pressure. Each segment is capable of growing into a new mycelium. This method is observed in some algae (e.g. Ulothrix, Dedogonium, Spirogyra and Zygnema ) and fungi (e.g. Mucor, Rhizophus, and Saprolegnia ). 4. Spore formation • Asexual reproduction takes place by a variety of motile and non-motile spores / conidia. • Ciliated motile asexual spore, called zoospores are produced by algae and fungi. These zoospores swim in water for some time with the help of their flagella. They later directly develops into new independent individuals under favorable conditions. e.g. Ulothrix , Chlamydomonas, Oedogonium . • Terrestrial fungi have non-flagellated and non-motile spores/ conidia. These spores are therefore light and dry. They are also provided with a tough coat and are well adapted for dispersal by wind. E.g. Penicillium, Aspergillus . • The structure bearing true spores is the sporangium. The sporangium is always present on a sporophyte. Thus, the sporophyte multiplies rapidly in an asexual manner to generate large numbers by spores. Some ferns ( Nephrolepis ) bear spores and reproduce asexually by them. These plants are homosporous (bear only one kind of spores). • While in Selaginella (pteridophyte ) and gymnosperms are hetrosporous (bear two types of spores). 5 ","6 ","Vegetative Propagation In flowering plants the method of vegetative propagation or reproduction are grouped into natural and artificial . (i) NATURAL METHODS • In natural methods of propagation there is development of a new plant from some organ of the mother plant under suitable environmental conditions. Such modified organs may develop from stem, leaf, root or even flower. • Vegetative reproduction • Through roots: sweet potato, Asparagus and Dahlia . • Through leaves: In this method buds develop in the margins of leaves. These buds produce new plants as can be seen in Bryophyllum • Through floral buds: In plants like Agave and Oxalis , floral buds produce new plants and in Dioscorea , axillary buds do so. • Through stem: Runners observed in lawn grass , offsets found in Pistia , Stolons in Nephrolepis and Suckers in mint plants . 7 ","(ii) ARTIFICAL METHODS • Methods are developed for artificial vegetative propagation in which some part of the plant organ is utilized for obtaining a new complete plant. Amongst them the most common methods are – cutting. Layering and grafting. a) Cutting • Cut pieces of root when planted in moist soil leads to the artificial inducement and development of adventitious roots. New plants are developed in this way in lemon and tamarind . 8 ","• In Rose, sugarcane, croton, china-rose and chrysanthemum plants are developed by cuttings that involve stem pieces containing nodes. They are planted in moist soil to develop new plants. Adventitious roots develop from the underground parts of stem, whereas buds develop and sprout on the aerial parts of stems. The plants, so developed is called a ‘cutting’. Later, these cutting s are transplanted in proper places. b) Layering • This method is employed in the cultivation of Rose, Lemon, Grape, Hibiscus and jasmine . The lower branches of the plants are bent and covered with soil in such a way that the tip of the branch remains outside the soil and the middle portion is buried inside the soil. Adventitious roots will develop from this buried region of plant stem. At that time this branch is cut and separated from the parent plant. Thus, a new plant is obtained. c) Grafting • Grafting is practiced in plants which have difficulty in establishing roots or generally have a weak root system. In this method two plants of the same or different kinds are joined together. This is achieved by bringing the tissues of the two plants in direct contact with each other. The meristematic tissue of both plants divide and multiply and eventually the cells of each plant fuse together. • The rooted plant is called stock plant. The plant which is being grafted on it is called scion . A plant possessing higher and desirable characters is selected as ‘scion’ . The stock is usually a strong, sturdy and hardy variety. Mango, Apple, Pear, Citrus, Guava, Litchi and many other fruit – yielding plants are thus obtained and maintained. • Grafting may be of different types, namely bud grafting, side grafting, and tongue grafting, wedge grafting and crown grafting depending on the methods of uniting the two parts. 9 ","SIGNIFICANCE OF VEGETATIVE REPRODUCTION 1. Vegetative reproduction is an ideal method of reproduction in plants where we wish to retain parental traits. 2. It is ideal for plants with less efficient sexual reproduction, small seeds, long seed dormancy, poor seed viability, etc. can also be multiplied easily through this method. 3. Vegetative reproduction is useful in obtaining disease-free plants. 4. Grafting can be used to bring together the desired characters from two plants. SEXUAL REPRODUCTION • Sexual reproduction involves formation of the male and female gametes, either by the same individual or by different individuals of the opposite sex. • The gametes formed then fuse to form the zygote which develops to form the new organism. It is a complex and slow process as compared to asexual reproduction. • As it involves the fusion of male and female gametes, offspring are not identical to the parents or amongst themselves. • Even with different external morphology, anatomy and physiology, the sexual mode of reproduction is similar in pattern in plants, animals and fungi. All organisms undergo general growth before reproductive growth. Only when they are reproductively mature they can reproduce sexually. This period of general growth is called the juvenile phase and in plants it is known as vegetative phase . • The events and processes of sexual reproduction are fundamentally similar in all organisms. However, the structures associated with sexual reproduction are quite different. • In all cases, the sexual reproduction is characterized by the fusion of the male and female gametes of the species. • For convenience these sequential events may be studied as three distinct stages namely, the pre fertilization, fertilization and the post fertilization. PRE-FERTILIZATION EVENTS 1. Gametogenesis • Gametogenesis is the process of formation of gametes. Gametes are of two types; male and female gametes derived from male and female parent respectively. Gametes are haploid (n) cells. • Gametes that are similar in appearance are called isogametes or homogametes . They are morphologically and physiologically similar ( e.g. Cladophora, Ulothrix ). 10 ","• A majority of sexually reproducing organisms show two morphologically and physiologically distinct types of gametes. Such gametes are called as heterogametes or anisogametes . The male gametes are smaller and more active whereas the female gametes are larger and sluggish . The male gametes is called anthrozoid or sperm and the female gamete is called egg or ovum . • Gametes are always haploids. The parent may be either haploid or diploid. A haploid parent produces haploid gametes by mitotic division. • Several organism belonging to Monera, Fungi, Algae and Bryophyta, Gymnosperms, Angiosperms and most of the animals are diploid. Here meiosis takes place to produce haploid gametes. • In diploid organisms when the meiocytes (gamete mother cell, diploid- 2n) undergo meiosis, only one set of chromosomes (n) gets incorporated in each gamete. Diversity of sexuality in organisms 11 ","2. Gamete transfer After their formation, the male and female gametes have to come in contact for fertilization. Male gamete is generally motile and the female gamete is usually stationary. Gamete transfer requires a suitable medium. In Algae, Bryophytes and Pteridophytes, water is the medium for gamete transfer. • A large number of the male gametes fail to reach the female gametes. Therefore, male gametes are synthesized in very large numbers as compared to female gametes. • In angiosperms, pollen grains carry the male gametes and ovule contains the egg cells. Pollen grains produced in anthers and are transferred to stigma. This phenomenon is known as pollination . Pollination requires the involvement of external agents such as insects, animals, wind and water. • Pollen grains germinate on the stigma and the pollen tubes that carry the male gametes reach the ovule and discharge two gametes near the egg cell. • In bisexual animals the organism must evolve a special mechanism for gamete transfer since male and female gametes are formed in different individuals. It is essential for fertilization. FERTILIZATION • The fusion of male and female gametes is called syngamy. As a result diploid zygote is formed. This process is known as fertilization . • In majority of algae, fishes and amphibians syngamy occurs outside the body of organisms. This type of gametic fusion is called external fertilization . This is seen in the bony fishes and frogs where a large number of offspring are produced. The offspring are extremely vulnerable to predators. This poses a threat to their survival. • In plants (i.e. fungi, bryophytes and pteridophytes) as well as reptiles, birds and mammals, syngamy occurs inside the body of the organism. Hence the process is called internal fertilization . In this process, the motile male gametes reach and fuse with the egg. This takes place inside the female body. • In seed plants, the non-motile male gametes are carried to female gamete by pollen tubes. 12 ","POST-FERILIZATION EVENTS 1. Zygote • Formation of zygote (2n) is common in sexual reproduction. In external fertilization, the zygote is formed in the external medium (water), whereas in internal fertilization, zygote is formed inside the body of organisms. • Further development of zygote depends on the life cycle of the organism and the environment to which it is exposed. In organisms, such as algae and fungi, zygote develops a thick wall resistant to desiccation and damage and commonly it undergoes a period of rest prior to germination. • Some unicellular animals ( e.g. Paramoecium ) exhibit sexual reproduction by forming male and female gamete nuclei, which they exchange through temporary cytoplasmic bridge. Later the cytoplasmic bridge appears and the gamete nucleus of one individual fuses with that of the other to form zygote nucleus. This mode of sexual reproduction is known as conjugation . • Zygote is the vital link that ensures continuity of species between organism of one generation and the next. Test 2. Embryogenesis • Embryogenesis is the process of development of embryo from the zygote. During embryogenesis zygote undergoes cell division (mitosis) and cell differentiation. • Cell divisions increase the number of cells in the developing embryo while cell differentiation helps group of cells to undergo certain modifications to form specialized tissues and organs to form organism. • In animals, when the development of zygote takes place inside the body of the female parent, it is called viviparous . • In oviparous animals like Reptile and Birds the fertilized eggs covered by hard calcerous shell are laid in a safe place in the environment. After a period of incubation, young ones hatch out. • On the other hand, in viviparous animals like mammals including human beings , the zygote develops into a young ones are delivered out of the body of the female parent. The chances of survival of young ones, are greater in viviparous organisms because of proper embryonic care and protection. 13 ","14 ","• In Angiosperms, the zygote is formed, inside the ovule. After fertilization, the sepals, petals and stamens of the flower fall off. The pistil, however, remains attached to the plant. • In plants: a. Zygote develops into embryo. b. Ovule develops into seed c. Integument of the ovule develops into seed coat. d. Ovary develops into fruit. e. Ovary wall develops into pericarp, is protective in function. After dispersal, seeds germinate under favorable condition to produce new plants. 15 ","SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS • Sexual reproduction is the process of development of new organisms from two parents through fusion of male and female gamete. • The flower is the main structure concerned with reproduction. The reproductive organs or the sporophylls are produced within the flowers. • The sporophylls are of two types microsporophylls (stamen) and megasporophylls (carpel) • Carpel is distinguished as ovary bearing ovule, style and stigma. • Stamen is distinguished as filament, anther and connective. • The whole process of sexual reproduction in flowering plants can be divided into three steps:- i) Pre-fertilization ii) Double fertilization iii) Post-fertilization PRE-FERTILISATION: STRUCTURE AND EVENTS The pre-fertilization events can be studied under following points:- i) Pollen grain formation ii) Embryo sac formation iii) Pollination 1 ","iv) Pollen pistil interaction POLLEN GRAIN FORMATION Male reproductive unit (Stamen) • A stamen is the male reproductive unit of angiosperms. It consists of an anther and a filament. The anther is bilobed and the lobe encloses four pollen sacs or microsporangia. • Each pollen sac contains number of pollen grains. The four pollen sacs lie in four corners of a dithecous anther. • Dithecous anther: An anther that contains two lobes that are joined together by a non-sporangious tissue called as the connective. • The anther wall is made up of four layers of cells. • An anther dehisces by slits to liberate pollen grains. Anther development • The anther development starts from a mass of homogenous meristematic cells surrounded by an epidermis. • Four lobes are formed and four layers of archesporial cells are differentiated. • Archesporial cells: A cell or a group of primitive cells that forms cells from which spores are developed. • Each archesporial cell divides to form two types of cells: a primary parietal cell and a primary sporogenous cell . • The parietal cell divides several times to form the anther wall whereas the sporogenous cell undergoes fewer divisions and forms the microspores or pollen mother cells (PMC). • The innermost layer of cell wall that lies in contact with the PMCs forms the tapetum . The tapetum is significant in pollen development. • Tapetum: It is a tissue present within the anther that provides nourishment to the growing spores. • The layer below the epidermis forms the endothecium. Wall layers of anther • Epidermis – single layer of cells and protective in function. 2 ","• Endothecium – Single layered second wall. Cells have a cellulose thickening with a little pectin and lignin. It helps in anther dehiscence. • Middle layers – Ranges from 1-6. The middle layer degenerates at the time of maturity of the anther. • Tapetum – a) Innermost layer of anther wall surrounding the sporogenous tissue. b) Tapetal cells are nutritive. c) They are multinucleated and polyploid. d) The ubisch bodies are deposited in the exine of microspore wall. e) The tapetum is of two types:- (i) Secretary / glandular – The tapetal cells remain in situ all through the development of microspore and finally they degenerate. ( ii) Amoeboid / periplasmodial – The tapetal cells break through the radial wall to release the protoplast into the pollen chamber. These protoplasts now fuse to form the periplasmodium. 3 ","Microsporogenesis • The formation and differentiation of microspore is called microsporogenesis . • The PMCs undergo meiosis. Each forms tetrahedral tetrads. • Cytokinesis may be successive or simultaneous. • Tetrad are of five types, tetrahedral, isobilateral, decussate, T shaped, linear.  Tetrahedral is most common. • In successive type, the cell wall is formed after meiosis – I as well as meiosis – II forming an isobilateral pollen tetrad. It is a characteristic feature of monocot. • In simultaneous type, each nuclear division in microspore mother cell is followed by cell wall formation. 4 ","• The microspores are separated from the tetrahedral arrangement. They are then surrounded by a two layered wall. The outer wall is called as the exine and inner wall is called as the intine . • The pollen grains are the first cells of the male gametophyte. • The tapetum gets used up and the anther becomes dry structure. This liberates the pollen by dehiscence of the anther. • All the four nuclei in a tetrad remain functional to form four microspores. • In some cases, all the four pollens remain attached forming compound pollen grains e.g. Juncus jatropha . 5 ","• In family Asclepiadaceae and Orchidacae, microspores are present as pollinium . • Pollinium: It is mass of pollen grains present at each anther lobe. As the pollinium is attached to the pollinating agents like insects, the entire mass of pollen grains is transferred as a unit. Pollen grain • Pollen grains vary in shapes. • It is generally round with size of 25 – 30μm . • Pollen grain is haploid, unicellular body with single nucleus. It has a two-layered wall. • Wall or sporoderm consists of two layers. • Outer layer is thick. It is called as the exine. It is made of sporopollenin. • Inner wall is thin and is called as the intine. It is made up of pecto-cellulose. • The exine is thick and sculptured or smooth. It is cuticularised and cutin is of special type called sporopollenin which is resistant to chemical and biological decomposition. This preserves the pollen wall for long periods. It also possess proteins for enzymatic and compatibility reactions. • Exine is differentiated into inner endexine and outer ektexine . Ektexine is further divided into inner continuous foot layer, middle discontinuous baculate layer and outermost discontinuous tectum. • Tectum aids in the identification of pollen grains and assigning them to their family, genus or species. • Pollen grain contains regions of pores or furrows. In these regions exine is absent. When the areas are circular they are called as germ pores . When the areas are elongated they are called as germ furrows . • Intine is thin and elastic. It is made up of cellulose and pectin. During pollen germination it is the intine that extends out to form the pollen tube. • The cytoplasm of the pollen grains is rich in starch and unsaturated oils. They are initially uninucleate and later becomes 2-3 celled. • In Calotropis and orchids, the pollen of each anther lobe formed a characteristics mass called pollinium. • Pollen grains can be monoclopate (having one germ pore), biclopate (two germ pores) and triclopate (3 germ pores). • The branch of study of pollens is called palynology . 6 ","Development of male gametophyte • The nucleus increases in size inside the pollen grain. It divides mitotically to produce two unequal daughter cells: A bigger vegetative cell or tube cell and smaller generative cell. • Pollination can occur when the pollen grain is two celled (tube + generative) or three-celled (tube + two male gametes). • However, in plants such as cereals, the male gametes form while the pollen is still within the anther. • In those cases, where pollen is shed at two celled stage, the generative cell divides after pollen has landed on stigma. • The cytoplasm of generative cell does not contain much of stored food material. • Fat, starch and protein granules are present in the vegetative cell. Pollen products 1. Pollen food supplements: Pollen grain contains abundant carbohydrates and unsaturated fat. They are used in the form of tablets and syrups for enhancing vital body functions. Pollen consumption increases performance and used by athletes and given to race horses. 2. Pollen creams: Pollen grain protect themselves from UV rays. Thus they are used in creams, emulsions for providing smoothness and protection to skin. Pollen viability • The period for which pollen grains remain viable or functional is called pollen viability. • It depends upon temperature and humidity. • Pollen grains remain viable for 30 minutes. • Pollen grain can be cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen (temp – 196°C) and used as pollen banks. 7 ","Pollen allergy • Pollen grain produce severe allergy. It causes have fever and common respiratory disorders as asthma, bronchitis. • Carrot grass ( Parthenium hysterophorus ) is major source of pollen allergy. It also causes harm to internal body organs. It was introduced in India along with imported wheat. FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE UNIT (Pistil) • The pistil or gynoecium of a flower is the female reproductive unit. • A carpel or pistil has three parts: stigma, style and ovary. • Stigma : The part that receives pollen grains • Style : The stalk that connects the stigma to the ovary. • Ovary : Swollen region present at the base. Ovary contains one to several ovules. • Ovule is the megasporangium that is surrounded by integuments. On fertilization the ovule ripens into a seed. It is oval and whitish. • Funicle/funiculus: Stalk that connects the ovule to the placenta. • Hilum: The point of attachment of funicle to the ovule. • A raphe (ridge) is formed by the fusion of funiculus with the body of ovule. • The actual part equivalent to the megasporangium is a parenchymatous tissue called nucellus. The nucellus could be thin or massive. • When the nucellus is thin it is called as tenuinucellate , e.g. Compositae family. • When the nucellus is massive it is called as crassinucellate e.g Casuarinaceae family. • On the basis of number of integuments, ovules are of following types:- (i) Unitegmic – With one integuments. It is seen in higher dicots like Compositae and gymnosperms. (ii) Bitegmic – Ovules with two integuments. It is seen in monocots and primitive dicots like Cruciferae and Malvaceae). (iii) Tritegmic – With three integuments like in Asphodelus (iv) Ategmic – Without integument. This is seen in Santalum, Loranthus, Ziriosoma and Olax . • Place of origin of integuments is called chalaza . • A pore is present in the integuments at the end opposite to the chalazal end. It is known as micropyle . • The inner region of integument may nourish the developing embryo sac. It is called as endothelium. • Outer region of each integument and the nucellus possesses cuticle . • In castor bean ( Ricinus ) the integumentary cells proliferate at the microplylar region. This forms a structure called as the caruncle . • It performs two functions:- i. It absorbs water and helps in seed germination. ii. It is made up of sugary substance and thus seed dispersal occurs by ants. 8 ","Forms of ovule • Orthotropous (Erect): – The body of the ovule lies straight and directly over the funicle. Hilum, chalaza and micropyle lie on the same line. E.g. Polygonum . • Anatropous (Inverted ) : - The body of ovule is inverted. The ovule is fused with the funicle. The fusion of the ovule with the funicle forms a ridge called raphe. Hilum and micropyle are close to the funicle. The chalaza is on the end opposite to the micropyle. It is the most common type of ovule. E.g. Ranunculus 9 ","• Hemianatropous: -The body of ovule is placed at right angle (90 o ) to the funicle e.g. Malpighiaceae. 10 ","• Campylotropous : -The body is curved but embryo sac is straight. Hilum, chalaza and micropyle come nearby e.g. Caspells, Capparis, Chenopodiaceae • Amphitropous:-Both body of ovule and embryo sac are curved e.g. crucifers 11 ","• Circinotropous: -The ovule turns at more than 360 O angle so funicle becomes coiled around the ovule. Example Opuntia . Megasporogenesis • The process of formation of megaspores from megaspore mother cell is called megasporogenesis. • Ovules commonly form a single megaspore mother cell (MMC) in micropylar region of the nucellus. It is a large cell and contains dense cytoplasm and prominent nucleus. • The MMC undergoes meiosis to form four megaspores. • In a majority of flowering plants, only one of the megaspores is functional. The other three degenerate. • Only the functional megaspore is able to develop into the female gametophyte. • Development of embryo sac from a single megaspore is called monosporic development . 12 ","Formation of embryo sac • The nucleus in the functional megaspore undergoes mitosis to form two nuclei. They move to the opposite poles. Thus, a two nucleate embryo sac is formed. • Two more sequential mitotic nuclear divisions occur. This leads to the formation of four nucleate and then eight nucleate stages of embryo sac. • These nuclear divisions are not followed immediately by cell wall formation. • After the eight nucleate stage, cell walls are laid down. This leads to the organization of the typical female gametophyte or embryo sac. • Six of eight nuclei are surrounded by cell walls and are organized into cells. The remaining two nuclei are called as the called polar nuclei. They are located just beneath the egg apparatus in the large central cell. • Three cells are present together at the micropylar end. They constitute the egg apparatus . • The egg apparatus consists of two synergids and one egg cell . • The synergids have special cellular thickenings at the micropylar tip called filiform apparatus . They play an important role in guiding the pollen tubes into the synergid. • Three cells are at chalazal end. They are called the antipodals . • Thus a typical angiosperm embryo sac has seven cells and eight nuclei at maturity. Pollination • Pollination is the process of transfer of pollen grains from anther and to the stigma of the flower • Pollination is of two types: self-pollination and cross pollination . • Self pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from anthers to the stigma of same flower or a different flower on the same plant. In self-pollination the flowers are genetically similar. Self pollination is of two types: autogamy and geitonogamy 13 ","1. Autogamy It is the transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of the same flower. It is favored due to the following adaptations: a) Chasmogamous devices • When the flower expose their mature anther and stigma to the pollinating agents. In Lilac the stigma lies directly beneath the anthers. b) Cleistogamy • The flowers remain closed so there is no alternative to self-pollination. Examples: Pisum, Lathyrus , Commelina benghalensis c) Bud pollination • Anthers and stigma of bisexual flowers mature before the bud opens. Thus self-pollination takes place at the time of bud stage itself e.g. pea, wheat etc. 2. Geitonogamy It is transfer of pollen grain from anther of one flower to stigma of another flower of same plant or genetically similar plants. Advantages of self pollination • It maintains purity of the race. • The plant does not need to produce large number of pollen grains. • It ensures seed production. • Self pollination eliminates bad recessive characters. Disadvantages of self pollination • Variable and hence adaptability to changed environment reduced. • Vitality decreases and ultimately leads to degeneration. Cross pollination • It is defined as the transfer of pollen grains from anther of a flower to the stigma of a different flower of another plant of same or different species. It is also known as allogamy. 14 ","• In Xenogamy , pollination takes between two flowers of plants that are genetically & ecologically different. Devices for cross pollination 1. Dicliny: There are two types of flowers, male and female. The plants may be monoecious or dioecious. 2. Dichogamy : Anther and stigma mature at different times. (i) Protandry : Anthers mature earlier. E.g, Salvia, Clerodendron , sunflower, rose (ii) Protogyny: Stigmas mature earlier. E.g. Plantago, Magnolia, Mirabilis 3. Self-sterility: Pollen grains are incapable of growing over the stigma of the same flower e.g. Tobacco, some crucifers. The ability of the pollen grain to grow faster on the stigma of another plant than of the same is called prepotency ( e.g. apple) 4. Heterostyly: Within the flowers the styles and the stamens are at different heights . Primula and Jasminum have two types of flower (dimorphic heterostyly ), pin-eye (long style and short stamen) and thrum-eye (short style and long stamens). Some plants have trimorphic (3) heterostyly e.g. Lathyrum , Oxalis . 5. Herkogamy: It is the presence of natural or physical barrier between androecium and gynoecium which help in avoiding self pollination. In Calotropis stignui , gynoecium is fused with pollinium and form gynostegium Advantages of cross pollination • Cross pollination introduces genetic recombination and hence variation in offspring. • Cross pollination increases the ability of the offspring to adapt to various changes in environment. • The defective character of race is eliminated and replaced by better character. Disadvantages of cross pollination • Plants have to produce a large number of pollen grains. • The very good character are likely to be spoiled. • As external agency is involved chance factor is always there. Agents of pollination: Anemophily (wind pollination) characteristics • Pollen grains are very light. They may have air sac or wings. • Flowers are small and are colorless, odorless. • Pollen grains are dry. 15 ","• Anthers have long filament and are abundant. • Stigmas are sticky and feathery. • Examples: Mulberry, Date palm, grass, coconut, willow, maize, jowar, cannabis. Hay fever is allergic reaction due to presence of pollen in air . Hydrophily (water pollination) characteristics • Flowers are small and colorless, odorless, nectarless. • Stigma is long, sticky and unwetable. Water pollination is of two types (a) Epihydrophily (on surface of water e.g. Vallisneria ) (b) Hypohydrophily (inside water) e.g. Zostera, Ceratophyllum . Pollen grains are without exine and often elongated. Vallisneria is dioecious. Male plants produces a large number of male flowers, which after breaking, rise upwards in closed state and open on surface of water. The female plant produces flowers that brings it on surface of water with the help of long pedicels. After pollination, the female flower is brought down into water Entomophily (Insect pollination) characteristics • Flowers are colored. Bluish-purplish – violet – yellow flowers attracts bees while reddish flowers attract butterflies and wasps. • Flowers commonly possess an aroma or scent. • Visiting insects are fed by either nectar or pollen. • Pollen grains are sticky due to pollenkitt. • Stigmas are sticky. Ornithophily (Bird pollination) • Pollination by birds is common in coral tree, bottle brush and silk cotton tree. • Two types of long – beaked small birds help to occur pollination – sun birds and humming bird. • Other birds are Bulbul, parrot, crow etc. • Ornithophilous flower are large and strong with abundant nectar and edible part. Example Bombax, Agave , Butea, Bignonia . Chiropterophily (Pollination by bats) • The flowers they pollinate are large dull colored and produce strong aroma. • Chiropterophilous flower produce abundant pollen grains and secrete more nectar than the orinthophilous flower. • Bats carry out the pollination in Adansonia and Kigelia . Malacophily (pollination by snails) • Snails perform pollination on Arisaema (snake orcobra plants) and some arum lilies. Myrmecophily (pollination by ants) • Pollination of flowers by ants is called myrmecophily. The plants that are pollinated by ants are called myrmecophytes. Examples include some members of family Rubiaceae. 16 ","Significance of pollination • Pollination is required for fertilization and therefore for production of seeds and fruits. • It stimulates growth of ovary. • It results in production of hybrid seeds. • The seeds and fruits are also a source of nutrition. Post pollination events • The nucleus of the pollen grain divides to produce vegetative and generative cells. • A small protrusion called germ tube , emerges from the pollen. The germ tube secretes enzymes which digests the tissues of stigma. The germ tube then continues to grow as pollen tube. • The generative nucleus gives rise to two male nuclei by division. They become surrounded by cytoplasmic masses and present as distinct male gametes. • The pollen tube grows through the stigma and passes into the tissues of style. • Entry of pollen tube into ovule is of different types depending upon the region of entry into ovule. These are:- i) Porogamy: The entry of pollen tube into the ovule through micropyle e.g. Ottelia ii) Chalazogamy: The entry of pollen tube into the ovule through chalaza e.g. Casuarina iii) Mesogamy : The entry of pollen tube into the ovule through funicle or integuments e.g. Cucurbita . 17 ","• In most cases the pollen tube enters the ovule through micropyle. It then enters the synergids through the filiform apparatus. • Filiform apparatus guides the entry of pollen tube. Pollen – pistil interaction • Only the compatible pollen of the same species are able to germinate. • Germination is related to the action of proteins present over the pollen grains and stigma that determine compatibility. • Plant breeders can obtain hybrid between different species by manipulating pollination. • In the female parent with bisexual flowers anthers are removed from the flower bud before the anther dehisces using a pair of forceps. This step is called as emasculation. • The stigma of the emasculated flowers have to be protected against contamination by unwanted pollen. They are therefore covered with a bag of suitable size to prevent deposition of unwanted pollen. The bag is generally made up of butter paper. This process is called bagging . DOUBLE FERTILIZATION • Fertilization is defined as the process of fusion of male and female gametes to form the zygote. The zygote will eventually develop into an embryo. • The pollen tube releases two male gametes into the embryo sac. One of the male gametes fuses with the egg, to form the diploid zygote. This is called syngamy or also called generative fertilization . • The second male gametes fuses with the two polar nuclei. This produces a triploid primary endosperm nucleus. This is called as triple fusion and is also known as vegetative fertilization . • In an embryo sac there occurs two sexual fusion – one in syngamy and other in triple fusion. This phenomenon is called double fertilization . 18 ","POST FERTILIZATION: STRUCTRE AND EVENTS Endosperms • Endosperm is a nutritive tissue formed from vegetative fertilization. Endosperm is meant for nourishing the embryo. It is generally triploid • The endosperm may show the effects of genes from the male gamete. The phenomenon is called xenia . This occurs because the endosperm is fully developed in a mature ovule. • The direct or indirect effect of pollen on structure inside embryo sac is limited to the endosperm and is not seen in the embryo. This effect was described by Focke 1881. It is seen in Zea mays (maize) alone. Metaxenia may be defined as the effect of pollen on the seed coat or pericarp lying outside the embryo sac • Endosperm can be classified into three types based on the mode of development- 1. Nuclear endosperm 19 ","• Primary endosperm nucleus forms a large number of free nuclei by repeated mitosis. • A central vacuole is then formed which pushes the large multinucleate cytoplasm to the periphery. • Walls are formed later and the central vacuole disappears. Example maize, wheat, rice. • In coconut there exists a multicellular solid endosperm in the outer region and a free nuclear liquid endosperm in the centre. 2. Cellular endosperm • Wall is formed after every division of primary endosperm nucleus. Therefore, the endosperm is cellular from the beginning e.g. Datura , balsam, Petunia 3. Helobial endosperm • First division produces two cells. Free nuclear division may occur within these cells. Ultimately they may also become cellular. E.g. Eremurus, Asphodelus . Functions of endosperms are (i) In plants with albuminous seeds the nutrients in the endosperm help in early seedling growth. (ii) Endosperm provides nutrition to developing embryo (iii) Liquid endosperm of coconut contains auxins, cytokinins and GA and induces cytokinesis when added to basic nutrient medium. Coconut milk can also be used to induce the differentiation of embryo and plantlets from various plant tissues (iv) Zeatin is a very potent cytokinin. It is extracted from the young endosperm of maize. Embyrogeny (embryo formation) • It is the development of mature embryo from zygote or oospore. • Early development produces a pro-embryo which has an axial symmetry. • Embryo passes through globular stage. 20 ","• Development of embryo occurs on inner side because of presence of suspensor. Thus, embryo development is endoscopic. • Dicot embryogeny ( crucifer / onagrad type ): • Zygote divides into two unequal cells: larger suspensor cell towards micropyle and a smaller embryo cell towards antipodal region. • The suspensor cell undergoes transverse division forming 6-10 celled suspensor. • The first cell of suspensor is called haustorium and last cell (towards embryo cell) is called hypophysis . It forms radicle. • Embryo cell divides twice. Vertically and once transversely to produce a two tired eight cell called embryo. The epibasal (terminal) tier forms two cotyledons and a plumule. The hypobasal (near the suspensor) tier produces only hypocotyls. • It is initially globular. It becomes heart shaped later and finally takes on the typical shape. • A typical dicotyledonous embryo consists of an embryonal axis and two cotyledons. • The part of embryonal axis above the level of cotyledons is called epicotyl . It ends with the stem tip called as the plumule. The plumule gives rise to the future shoot • The part below the level of cotyledons is called hypocotyls . It terminates in the root tip called radicle. The radicle gives rise to the future root. The root tip is covered with root cap. In Caspella bursa pastoris , the curving of the ovule causes the cotyledons to curve as they emerge and elongate. The embryo does not differentiate into plumule, cotyledon and radical in orchids such as Orboanche and Utricularis . • Monocot embryogeny ( Sagittaria type) • The zygote undergoes transverse division to produce a vesicular suspensor cell facing the micropylar end and embryo cell facing the chalazal end. • The embryo cell undergoes another transverse division to form a terminal and middle cell. • The terminal cell undergoes vertical as well as transverse divisions to form a globular embryo. It also forms a large cotyledon and a plumule. As the cotyledon grows it pushes the plumule to one side. In some grasses the remnants of the second cotyledon may be seen. It is known as epiblast . The single cotyledon of monocots is known as the scutellum . It is shaped like a shield and appears as terminal. • The middle cell produces the hypocotyls and radicle. It could result in increasing the cells of the suspensor. Protective sheaths cover both the radicle and the plumule. They are called as the coleorhizae and coleoptiles respectively. • They may be extensions of scutellum. 21 ","Formation of seed and fruit 22 ","Fruit: Ripened ovary or fertilized ovary is called fruit . Wall of the ovary forms fleshy or dry fruit wall called pericarp . Fleshy fruit or pericarp has three layers – epicarp, mesocarp and endocarp. It is the covering of fruit that develops from ovary wall. • It is a part of fruit and is dry or fleshy. • It is protective covering and provide nutrition to seed. • Ripened ovules are known as seeds . • Integuments of ovule forms seed coat . Outer integuments form testa and tegmen develops from inner integuments. • A type of third integuments or aril is present in some case like litchi, ingadulce (Pithecolobium), Asphodelus, Trianthema . It provides an additional covering of seed. • In certain seeds like castor ( Ricinus communis ) a spongy outgrowth is present near the micropyle. It is known as caruncle . It aids by absorbing water during seed germination. • Funiculus forms seed stalk. The stalk ultimately withers and leaves a minute scar called hilum . • Smallest seeds are found in orchids. They are the lightest in plant kingdom and are therefore called dust seeds . Fresh weight of each orchid seed is around 20.33μg . • Largest seeds are those of double coconut ( Zodoicea maldivica ) which are bilobed and each seed has a weight of 6kg. • Depending upon the presence or absence of endosperm the seeds are classified as follows- i) Non-endospermic or ex-albuminous : Food stored in endosperm is completely used up by developing embryo. Example: gram, pea, bean, orchid. ii) Endospermic or albuminous: Endosperm grows vigorously and is not used up completely by the developing embryo. In this case the cotyledons are thin. Examples: Seed of wheat, barley, castor, poppy etc. 23 ","Importance of seeds • Evolutionary achievement: Seed is an evolutionary achievement. It provides protection to embryo. • Seeds have sufficient food reserve that nourishes the germinating embryo. • Seeds can colonize and populate new areas and spread and propagate its species because of dispersal. • Being products of sexual reproduction, seeds have number of variation and variation helps in adaptation to varied environment. • Germination and sowing of seeds by humans gave rise to agriculture and it helped in development of civilization, science and technology. Seed viability • It is the period of time for which the seeds retain the ability to germinate. • Seed viability is determined genetically as well as environmentally. • Environmental conditions which can alter viability are humidity and temperature. • Genetically, seed viability ranges from a few days (e.g. Oxalis ), one season (e.g. Birch), and 2-5 years (most crop plants) to 100 years (e.g. Trifolium ). • Seed viability has been found out to be more than 1000 years in Lotus. 2000 year-old seeds of Phoenix dactylifera that were excavated from K ing Herod’s palace near the Dead Sea have been found to be viable. • Similarly 10,000 year old seeds of Lupins arcticus (Lupine) excavated from Arctic Tundra not only germinated but also produced plants that flowered. • Viability of the seed is tested by its- (a) Respiration (b) Germination • Respiring seed turns colorless triphenyl tetrazolium chloride into pink tripheyl formazan. i) Apomixis [Gk. apo – without, mixis – marriage] • It is the formation of new individuals by asexual methods which mimic sexual reproduction including seed formation but do not involve fusion of gametes or sex cells. • Normal type of sexual reproduction having two regular features, i.e. meiosis and fertilization, is called amphimixis . 24 ","• The organism reproducing through apomixes is called apomicts . • Apomixis is controlled by gene and individuals are genetically similar to the parent producing them i.e. are clone and members of a clone are called ramets . It occurs by following methods: a) Formation of asexual seeds if the embryo develops directly without gametic fusion. b) Sporophytic budding if embryo develops adventitiously from diploid cells of nucellus or integument, e.g. mango, orange, Opuntia , onion. ii) Parthenogenesis [Gk. Parthenos – virgin; genesis – descent] • It is the development of a new individual from a single gamete without fusion with another gamete . • Depending upon the ploidy of the gametes, there are two types of gametes, there are two types of parthenogenesis – haploid and diploid. • In haploid parthenogenesis, the embryo sac and its egg are haploid. • In diploid parthenogenesis, the embryo sac, as its contained egg, is diploid. It undergoes parthenogenesis and forms diploid embryo. • Diploid parthenogenesis is generally accompanied by failure of meiosis during megasporogenesis as well as direct formation of embryo sac from a nucellar cell, e.g. Poa, apple, rubus iii) Apogamy (Gk. Apo – without, gamos – arriage) • It is formation of sporophyte or embryo directly from cells of gametophyte. • In higher plants, only diploid apogamy is successful, that is, the gametophytic cell forming the sporophyte is diploid. In lower plants, haploid apogamy is equally successful. Polyembryony • The phenomenon of having more than one embryo is called polyembryony . • Occurrence of polyembryony due to fertilization of more than one egg cell is called simple polyembryony . • Formation of additional embryos can also occur from different parts of ovule like synergids, antipodal, nucellus, integuments etc. • Example – Citrus , groundnut, onion , Opuntia, Mangifera • Leeuwenhoek discovered polyembryony was in 1719. The same was confirmed by Schnarf in 1929 . • Polyembryony is more commonly seen in gymnosperms than in angiosperms . • Polyembryony can be false or true embryony • In false embryony, multiple embryos arise in different embryo sacs in the ovule whereas in true embryony multiple embryos are formed in the same embryo sac. • The cause of polyembryony may be :- -Cleavage of proembryo e.g. family orchidaceae. -Development of many embryos from other cells of embryo sac except egg. E.g. Argemone -Formation of many embryos due to presence of more than one embryo sac in same ovule e.g. Citrus -Formation of many embryos from the structure outside the embryo sac e.g. mango, Opuntia • Polyembryony is important for practical reasons because genetically uniform parental type seedlings can be obtained from nucellar embryos • Nucellar embryos are qualitatively superior to those obtained by vegetative propagation as nucellar embryo seedlings are free from diseases and maintain their superiority for long time. 25 ","Parthenocarpy: (Gk. Parthenos – virgin, karpos – fruit) • It is the process of formation of fruit without an event of fertilization . • Parthenocarpic fruits are seedless e.g. apple, pear, banana, pineapple etc • Fruits that have seeds with an asexual embryo or pseudoseeds are also parthenocarpic fruit. • Parthenocarpy is of three types: genetic, environmental and chemically induced- Genetic parthenocarpy:  • Parthenocarpy is due to genetic alteration caused by mutation or hybridization. It is also called natural parthenocarpy . E.g. banana, apple, pineapple, varieties of grapes, pear Environmental parthenocarpy:  • Low temperature, frost and fog can induce parthenocarpy in a number of plants examples: pear, olive, capsicum, tomato Chemically induced parthenocarpy:  • Spray or paste of auxins and gibberellins in low concentration of 10 -6 – 10 -7 M has been found to induce parthenocarpy in several plants. Example: tomato, citrus, strawberry, blackberry, fig etc. Importance of parthenocarpic fruits • They do not contain seeds which have to be removed before eating fruits. • Fruits can be developed inside the green houses where pollinators are not available. • Quicker food processing. 26 ","Chapter 3 Human Reproduction Basic Steps in Human Reproduction: 1. Gametogenesis 2. Insemination 3. Fertilization 4. Blastocyst development 5. Implantation 6. Embryo development 7. Parturition 3.1: Male Reproductive System The male reproductive system has four main parts: 1. Testes 2. Accessory ducts 3. Glands 4. External Genitalia Testes (singular Testis): • Situated in the pelvic region outside the abdominal cavity within a pouch called as scrotum. • Scrotum is a small muscular sac that contains and protects the testes. It is a part of the external male genitalia and is located behind the penis. • The testes are placed outside the abdominal cavity so as to maintain a temperature that is 2-2.5 ◦ C lower than the average human body temperature. • The lower temperature in testes is required for spermatogenesis as the normal human body temperature can lead to mutation in the sperms. • Testis is oval in shape. It is 4-5cm long and 2-3cm wide. • Each testis has about 250 compartments called as Testicular lobules 1 ","• Each lobule contains 1-3 highly coiled seminiferous tubules. • Seminiferous tubules are the site for meiosis that leads to the formation of spermatozoa. ➢ The inner lining of each seminiferous tubule consists of two types of cells: Spermatogonia and Sertoli cells. ➢ Spermatogonia are the immature male germ cells that undergo meiosis that leads to formation of sperms. Each spermatogonium is diploid and contains 46 chromosomes ➢ Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the spermatogonia ➢ Interstitial spaces: These are the regions outside the seminiferous tubules. They contain small blood vessels, some immunocompetent cells and interstitial cells or the Leydig cells. ➢ Leydig cells: These are the cells that synthesise and secrete testicular hormones called androgens. 2 ","Accessory Ducts: The accessory ducts transport the sperms from the testes to the urethra for their release outside the body. There are four accessory ducts in the male reproductive system: • Rete Testis • Vasa efferentia • Epididymis • Vas deferens ➢ Rete testis: These are the ducts that connect the seminiferous tubules of the testes to the vasa efferentia. ➢ Vasa efferentia: These ducts leave the testes and open into the epididymis that is located in the posterior surface of each testis. ➢ Epididymis: It is located on the posterior surface of each testis and opens into the vas deferens. ➢ Vas deferens: It is a duct that ascends into the abdominal cavity and loops over the urinary bladder. It receives a duct from the seminal vesicle and opens into the urethra as ejaculatory duct. ➢ Ejaculatory duct: They store and transport the sperms from the testis to the outside through the urethra. ➢ Urethra: It is a thin muscular tube. It originates from the urinary bladder. It then passes through the penis to its external opening called as the urethral meatus. Accessory Glands: They are: • Seminal vesicles • Prostate gland • Bulbourethral glands These glands secrete products that mix with the sperms to nourish and protect them. 3 ","• Seminal vesicles: They contribute approximately 60-75% of the fluid in semen. The secretions are rich in proteins, enzymes, fructose, vitamin C, phosphoryl choline and prostaglandins. The high fructose content provides nutrient energy for the spermatozoa. • Prostate Gland: It secretes a slightly alkaline milky fluid. This helps in the survival of sperms in the acidic vaginal environment. The secretions also improve the motility of the sperms • Bulbourethral glands: The secretions of this gland lubricate the penis and neutralise any residual acidity in the urethra. 3.2: Female Reproductive System The human female reproductive system is specialised to support the process of gametogenesis, ovulation, fertilisation, pregnancy, birth and child care. The parts of the female reproductive system are: 1. A pair of ovaries 2. A pair of oviducts 3. Uterus 4. Cervix 5. Vagina 6. External genitalia 7. Mammary glands Ovaries: • They are the primary female sex organs • They produce the female gamete- ovum • They also produce steroid hormones (Ovarian hormones) • 2-4cm in length and connected to the pelvic wall and uterus by ligaments • Each ovary is covered by a thin epithelium enclosing an ovarian stroma • Ovarian stroma- It is the matrix of the ovary and is divided into two zones ➢ Peripheral cortex ➢ Inner medulla Accessory Ducts: They are the oviducts, uterus and the vagina 4 ","Oviduct (Fallopian Tube): • Each fallopian tube is 10-12 cm long • It extends from the periphery of each ovary to the uterus • Infundibulum: It is the funnel shaped part closer to the ovary • Fimbriae: They are the finger like projections at the edges of the infundibulum that aid in collecting the ovum after ovulation • Ampulla: It is the wider part of the oviduct after the infundibulum • Isthmus: It is the last part of the oviduct. It has a narrow lumen and joins the uterus Uterus: • It is also called as the womb • It is shaped like an inverted pear • It is attached to the pelvic wall by ligaments • The uterus is the part where the embryo develops into the foetus • The uterus opens into the vagina through a narrow cervix • Uterine wall has three layers of tissues: perimetrium, myometrium and the endometrium • Perimetrium: It is the thin external membranous layer • Myometrium: It is the thick middle layer made up of smooth muscle. It exhibits strong contractions during the delivery of the baby • Endometrium: It is the inner glandular layer that lines the uterine cavity. It undergoes periodic changes during the menstrual cycle. Cervix: • It is a narrow canal connecting the uterus to the vagina • Cervical canal: The cavity of the cervix is called as the cervical canal. • Birth canal: The cervical canal along with the vagina forms the birth canal External Female Genitalia: They consist of: mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, hymen and clitoris Mons pubis: It is a mass of fatty tissue covered by skin and hair Labia majora: They are fleshy folds of tissue that extend from the mons pubis and cover the vaginal opening Labia minora: They are the paired folds of tissue under the labia majora 5 ","Hymen: It is a membrane that partially covers the opening of the vagina. It is often torn during the first intercourse or coitus. It can also be broken by active participation in some sports like horseback riding, cycling, etc., a sudden fall or jolt, insertion of a vaginal tampon, etc. In some women the hymen can persist even after coitus. The presence or absence of hymen is not a reliable indication of virginity or sexual experience. Clitoris: It is a tiny finger-like projection that lies at the junction of the labia minora above the urethral opening. Mammary Glands: The presence of functional mammary glands is characteristic of all female mammals • They are paired structures of breasts that contain glandular tissue and variable amounts of fats. • Glandular tissue in each mammary gland consists of 15-20 mammary lobes. • The mammary lobes have clusters of cells called alveoli • The cells of alveoli secrete milk. • The milk is stored in the lumen or cavities of the alveoli • The alveoli open into mammary tubules. • The tubules of each lobe join to form a mammary duct. • Several mammary ducts join to from a wider mammary ampulla • The mammary ampulla is connected to a lactiferous duct through which milk is sucked out. 3.3: Gametogenesis Gametogenesis is the process by the primary male and female sex organs produce the male and female gametes respectively. Spermatogenesis: The process by which the immature male germ cells or spermatogonia produce mature sperm cells in the testis Oogenesis: The process by which the immature oogonia in the ovaries produce mature ovum Spermatogenesis: The process of spermatogenesis begins at puberty and proceeds as follows: 1. The spermatogonia multiply by mitosis to increase in number. They are present in in the inner wall of seminiferous tubules. Each spermatogonium is diploid. Each spermatogonium contains 46 chromosomes. 6 ","2. Some spermatogonia called as the primary spermatocytes periodically undergo meiosis to form two equal, haploid cells called as the secondary spermatocytes. They contain 23 chromosomes. 3. The secondary spermatocytes produce four equal haploid cells after they undergo second meiotic division. They are called as the spermatids. They contain 23 chromosomes. 4. The spermatids undergo spermiogenesis to form spermatozoa or sperms. 5. The sperm heads are embedded in the Sertoli cells 6. They are finally released from the seminiferous tubules by the process of spermiation • Spermatogonia are the immature male germ cells that undergo meiotic divisions to form sperms. Each spermatogonium is diploid and contains 46 chromosomes • Primary spermatocytes are spermatogonia that undergo periodic meiosis to form two equal haploid cells called as the secondary spermatocytes. The primary spermatocytes contain 46 chromosomes • Secondary spermatocytes are haploid cells arising from the primary spermatocytes as a result of meiosis I. They contain 23 chromosomes. • Spermatids are the haploid cells that arise from the secondary spermatocytes as a result of meiosis II. They contain 23 chromosomes • Spermiogenesis is the process by which spermatids mature to form spermatozoa. • Spermiation is the process by which mature spermatozoa are released from the seminiferous tubules. Hormones affecting spermatogenesis: Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH): It is a hormone secreted by the hypothalamus. Its levels increase significantly at puberty. The increased levels of GnRH stimulates the release of two gonadotropins – Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH), from the anterior pituitary. Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH): FSH acts on the Sertoli cells and stimulates the release of some factors that help in the process of spermatogenesis. Luteinizing Hormone (LH): LH acts on the Leydig cells and stimulates the synthesis and secretion of androgens which in turn stimulate the process of spermatogenesis. 7 ","Structure of Sperm: • It consists of a head, neck, middle piece and a tail • Plasma membrane covers the whole body of the sperm • The head portion of the sperm contains a haploid nucleus • The anterior portion of the head contains an acrosome. • Acrosome is a structure that is filled with digestive enzymes that help in the dissolving the membrane of the egg cell and help in fertilization of the ovum. • Middle Piece: It contains numerous mitochondria that produce energy for the movement of the tail. This is important for the motility of the sperm which is essential for fertilization. • During ejaculation 200-300 million sperms are released. At least 60% of them should have normal shape and size and at least 40% should show vigorous motility. • Semen: Semen is a milky white organic fluid released by the penis during ejaculation. It consists of the sperms and the fluids secreted by the accessory ducts and the accessory glands such as the epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate and the bulbourethral glands. • The testicular hormones (androgens) maintain the functions of the male accessory ducts and glands. Oogenesis: The process of formation of a mature female gamete is oogenesis and it is initiated during the embryonic development stage. During this stage a couple of million gamete mother cells or oogonia are formed in the foetal ovary. No more oogonia are formed and added after birth. • The oogonia form primary oocytes . The oogonia start the process of meiosis and get arrested at the stage of Prophase I. These cells originating from the oogonia that are arrested at the prophase I are called as primary oocytes. • Each primary oocyte gets surrounded by a layer of granulosa cells and is now called as the primary follicle. • A large number of primary follicles get degenerated between birth and puberty. At puberty, therefore, there are only about 60,000-80,000 primary follicles in the ovary. • These remaining primary follicles get surrounded by more layers of granulosa cells as well as a new theca. They now form the secondary follicle. • The secondary follicle then gives rise to the tertiary follicle . The tertiary follicle is characterised by the presence of a fluid filled cavity called as antrum. The theca is organised into two layers-inner theca interna and the outer theca externa. The primary oocyte grows in size and completes the first meiotic division. It is an unequal division forming a large secondary oocyte and a tiny first polar body. 8 ","• Secondary oocyte retains much of the nutrient rich cytoplasm. • The tertiary follicle changes into the mature Graafian follicle. • The secondary oocyte forms a new layer called as the zona pellucida around it. • The Graafian follicle now ruptures to release the secondary oocyte (ovum) from the ovary by the process of ovulation . 9 ","3.4: Menstrual Cycle: • Menstrual Cycle: The reproductive cycle in the female primates like monkeys, apes and human beings is called as the menstrual cycle. The cycle of events starting from one menstruation till the next one is called menstrual cycle. This cycle is essential for the production of oocytes and for the preparation of uterus for pregnancy. The cycle repeats 28-35 days and normally one egg is released per cycle. • Menstruation: Menstruation is the process by which blood and mucosal tissue are regularly discharged in a periodic manner from the inner lining of the uterus through the vagina. It is also known as a period or monthly. • Menarche: Menarche is the first menstruation for a human female. It begins at puberty. The actual age for menarche varies from person to person. Menarche signals the beginning of reproductive age in females. • Menopause: Menopause is the permanent ceasing of menstrual cycle in females due to the depletion of oocytes as a result of aging. The age of menopause varies from person to person. The average age of menopause is between 45-50 years. Phases of the Menstrual Cycle: Menstrual cycle follows four phases: 1. Menstrual phase 2. Follicular phase 3. Ovulation 4. Luteal Phase 1. Menstrual Phase: This is the period of menstruation when the menstrual flow occurs. • It typically lasts from 3-5 days. • There is breakdown of the endometrial lining of the uterus and its blood vessels which forms a liquid substance that comes out of the vagina. • It occurs when the ovum released by the ovary is not fertilised. • Lack of menstruation may indicate pregnancy • Menstruation may also be affected due to stress, poor diet, poor health, etc. 2. Follicular Phase: This is the phase of maturation of follicle • The primary follicles in the ovary grow to form a fully mature Graafian follicle. • The endometrium of the uterus regenerates through proliferation. • These changes in ovary and uterus are induced by ovarian hormones- Luteinising Hormone (LH) and the Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH). 10 ","• The levels of gonadotropins gradually increase through the follicular phase • The increased levels of-LH and FSH gonadotropins stimulate follicular development. They also stimulate secretion of oestrogens by the growing follicles. 3. Ovulation/Ovulatory Phase: This is the phase of release of ovum from ovary • The levels of LH and FSH reach their peak at mid-cycle, around 14 th day. • LH surge: The rapid increase in LH mid cycle leading to maximum LH level mid cycle is called as the LH surge. This induces the rupture of the Graafian follicle and thereby the release of ovum. • Ovulation: The process by which an ovum is released by a mature Graafian follicle from the ovary. It is a result of the LH surge which occurs mid-cycle around the 14 th day. 4. Luteal Phase : This is the phase of formation of corpus luteum • The remaining parts of the Graafian follicle after ovulation form the corpus luteum. Corpus luteum is therefore the structure that is formed the ruptured Graafian follicle. • The corpus luteum secretes large amounts of progesterone which is essential for the maintenance of endometrium. The endometrium is necessary for the implantation of the fertilised ovum and other events of pregnancy. ❖ During pregnancy all events of menstrual cycle stop and there is no menstruation. ❖ In absence of pregnancy the corpus luteum degenerates. This causes breakdown of the endometrium leading to menstruation and thus starting the new cycle. 11 ","3.5: Fertilisation and Implantation: • Insemination: During coitus or copulation semen is released into the vagina by the penis. • The motile sperms swim rapidly through the cervix, enter into the uterus and finally reach the ampullary region of the fallopian tube. • The ovum released by the ovary is also transferred to the ampullary region of the fallopian tube. • Fertilisation occurs in the fallopian tube only if the ovum and sperms are simultaneously transferred into the ampullary region of the fallopian tube. • Fertilisation: It is the fusion of the sperm and the egg. During fertilisation the sperm induces changes in the zona pellucida layer of the ovum that block the entry of additional sperms ensuring that only one sperm can fertilise an ovum. • The secretions of the acrosome help the sperm enter the ovum through the zona pellucida and the plasma membrane. • This induces the secondary oocyte to complete meiosis. This is again an unequal division. It results in the formation of a second polar body and a haploid ovum. • The haploid nuclei of the sperm and the ovum fuse to form a diploid zygote. The zygote contains 46 chromosomes. • The sex of the foetus is determined by the sex chromosome present in the sperm. As the female is XX the ovum will always carry the X chromosome. Males are XY and therefore, the sperm can contain either X or Y. Therefore, half of all the sperms carry the X chromosome and the other half carry the Y chromosome. Depending on whether the X-containing sperm or the Y-chromosome fuses with the ovum, the zygote will be female or male. • The zygote undergoes mitotic cleavage as it moves along the isthmus of the oviduct towards the uterus. It forms 2, 4, 8 and 16 daughter cells called as blastomeres. • Morula: The embryo with 8-16 blastomeres. • The morula continues division as it moves further along into the uterus. The blastomeres arrange in to an outer layer called as the trophoblast. The inner cell mass is attached to the trophoblast. • The trophoblast attaches to the endometrium • The inner cell mass differentiates to form the embryo • The cells of the uterus divide rapidly and cover the blastocyst. The blastocyst thus embeds in the uterine wall. This is called as implantation. This leads to pregnancy. 12 ","3.6: Pregnancy and Embryonic Development: • After implantation finger-like projections called as chorionic villi appear on the trophoblast. • The chorionic villi are surrounded by uterine tissue and maternal blood. It causes the chorionic villi and the uterine tissue to become interdigitated with each other and jointly form a structural and functional unit between the developing foetus and the maternal body called as the placenta. • Placenta supplies oxygen and nutrients to the developing embryo and removes the carbon dioxide and excretory waste from the foetus. • The placenta is connected to the embryo through umbilical cord . The embryo transports nutrients and wastes to and from the placenta through the umbilical cord. • Additionally the placenta functions as an endocrine gland. It produces several hormones such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), human placental lactogen (hPL), oestrogens, progesterone, etc. • Later in the pregnancy another hormone called as relaxin is produced by the ovary. • During pregnancy production of various hormones is increased. These hormones include oestrogens, progesterone, cortisol, thyroxine, prolactin, etc. High levels of these hormones are essential for supporting foetal growth, metabolic changes in pregnancy as well as maintenance of pregnancy. • Soon after implantation the embryo differentiates into the outer ectoderm and the inner endoderm. The mesoderm develops soon after. These three tissues soon give rise to the tissues in the body. • The inner cell mass contains stem cells that have the ability to give rise to all the tissues and organs in the body. • Foetal development: o 1 month- heart is formed o 2 month- limbs and digits are formed o 3 months- most of the major organ systems are formed o 5 months- appearance of hair on the head and the first movements of the foetus o 6 months- body is covered with fine hair, eyelids separate, eyelashes are formed o 9 months – foetus is fully developed and ready for delivery 13 ","3.7: Parturition and Lactation: o Gestation Period: The average duration of pregnancy is called as gestation period. In humans the gestation period is 9 months o Parturition: The process of childbirth by which the foetus is expelled or delivered due to vigorous contractions of the uterus. o A fully developed foetus and placenta induces parturition. This causes mild uterine contractions called foetal ejection reflex. o This triggers the release of oxytocin from the mother’s pituitary. o Oxytocin stimulates stronger uterine contractions which stimulates more production of oxytocin o The stimulatory positive feedback reflex continues between the uterine contractions and oxytocin secretion. This leads to stronger and stronger contractions till the baby is expelled out of the uterus through the birth canal. o Soon after the foetus is delivered the placenta is also delivered. o Lactation: The production of milk by the mammary glands of the females towards the end of the pregnancy is called lactation. o Colostrum: The milk produced during the initial few days of lactation is called as the colostrum. It is rich in antibodies that provide resistance and immunity to the new-born. 14 ","Chapter 4 Reproductive Health Reproductive Health: The complete well-being with respect to all aspects of reproduction like physical, emotional, behavioural and social. A society with people having physically and functionally normal reproductive organs as well as normal interactions with respect to behaviour and emotion among them is reproductively healthy. 4.1: Reproductive Health- Problems and Strategies • Family planning measures were initiated in 1951 in India. The goal was to attain total reproductive health. These measures were periodically evaluated. • Reproductive and Child Health Care (RCH) Programs are being operated with the aim of creating awareness among people about various reproduction related aspects and providing facilities and support for building a reproductively healthy society. • Steps to Achieve Reproductive Health: ➢ Governmental and non-governmental agencies should use media-both print and audio-visual, to create awareness programs ➢ Responsible adults, parents, teachers, close relatives and friends should provide correct information and be willing to open dialogues with young adults and children to sensitise them about reproductive health ➢ Introduction of sex education in schools and colleges ➢ Create awareness about Sexually Transmitted Diseases or STDs. ➢ Educating people, especially fertile couples and marriageable individuals about birth control options, pre and post-natal care, infant and child care, importance of breast feeding, equal opportunities for males and females, will help in bringing up socially conscious and healthy families of desired size. ➢ Create awareness about problems of population explosion, sex abuse and sex related crimes. ➢ Provision and availability of strong infrastructural facilities, professional expertise and material support for successful implementation of health plans. These also help in providing medical facilities and care to people with reproduction related problems. ➢ Implementation of newer, better and upgraded facilities with respect to reproductive health ➢ Complete ban on foetal sex determination to check female foeticide. ➢ Large scale child immunization programs For decreased maternal and infant mortality rates there should be: • Better awareness of sex-related matters • Increase in medically assisted deliveries • Better post-natal care leads. Improved reproductive health of the society is indicated by: • Smaller families, • Better detection and cure for STDs • Overall increased medical facilities. 4.3: Population Explosion and Birth Control Population Explosion: The rapid growth of population of a particular species, specifically of the humans in the world since the end of World War II. This can be attributed to a constantly increasing birth rate, a decrease in child and infant mortality, and an increase in life expectancy. This will lead to increased stress on all resources. Causes: • Rapidly declining death rate 1 ","• Rapidly declining maternal mortality rate (MMR) • Rapidly declining infant mortality rate (IMR) • Increased life expectancy • Increase in number of people in reproducible age Methods to Control Population Explosion: • Promote smaller families • Promote use of contraceptive methods • Raise the legal age for marriage (18 years for females and 21 years for males) • Incentivise couples with smaller families. Ideal Contraceptive: • Should be easy to use • Should be easily available • Should be effective • Should not have side effects • Should be reversible • Should not interfere with the sexual drive, desire or act of the individual Methods of Contraception: 1. Natural or Traditional 2. Barrier Methods 3. Intra-uterine devices (IUDs) 4. Oral contraceptives 5. Injectable and implants 6. Surgical Methods 1. Natural Methods: It works on the principle of avoiding the chances of sperm and egg meeting. • Periodic Abstinence: In this method couples avoid coitus between 10 th and 17 th day of the menstrual cycle as during this period the chance of ovulation is maximum. Therefore, abstaining from coitus during this fertile period decreases the chance of pregnancy • Withdrawal or Coitus interruptus: In this method the male withdraws the penis from the vagina during coitus just before ejaculation. Therefore, he prevents the release of semen and thus prevents insemination. • Lactational amenorrhea: This is the period of absence of menstruation during the period of lactation. As there is no menstruation it is believed that during this period there is no ovulation and therefore decreased chances of pregnancy. However, this method is effective only up to six months after parturition during the period of intense lactation. As no chemicals are used the chances of side effects are nil. However, success of contraception is also limited and therefore, chances of failure of contraception are also high. 2. Barrier Methods: In this method sperms and ovum are physically prevented from meeting with the help of barriers. • Condoms: Barriers made of thin rubber or latex sheath that cover the penis in males and the cervix in females. 2 ","• Both male and female condoms are disposable. • As use of condoms prevents contact of genital fluids it also helps in preventing STDs • Reusable barriers like diaphragms, cervical caps and vaults are inserted into the female cervix during coitus to prevent the entry of sperms through the cervix. • Spermicidal creams, jellies and foams are used with these barriers to increase the efficiency of these methods. 3. Intra-Uterine Devices (IUDs): These devices are inserted into the uterus by doctors or expert nurses through the vagina. • Non-medicated IUDs like Lippes Hoopes increase phagocytosis of sperms • Copper releasing IUDs like Copper-T, Copper-7, Multiload 375 decrease motility of sperms • IUDs that release hormone like Progestasert, LNG-20 make the uterus unsuitable for implantation. They also make the cervix hostile to sperms. These devices are ideal contraceptives for the females for family planning and are among the most widely used methods of contraception. 4. Oral Contraceptives: This involves the oral administration of progestogens or progesterone-oestrogen combinations in the form of pills. They are used by females for a period of 21 days starting within the first five days of the menstrual cycle. After a gap of 7 days (during which menstruation occurs) the cycle is repeated until the female wishes to conceive. Newer pills like Saheli are once a week non-steroidal pills with lesser side effects These pills work by inhibiting ovulation and implantation as well as altering the quality of cervical mucus to retard or prevent the entry of sperms. 5. Injectable and implants: 3 ","Progesterone alone or in combination with oestrogens can be used by females as injections or implants under the skin. Such injectables and implants are functionally similar to pills and their effective period is much longer. 6. Surgical Methods: Surgical intervention functions by blocking the transport of gametes and thereby prevent conception. They are terminal methods of contraception and are therefore also called as sterilisation. Sterilisation in males is called as vasectomy and in females is called as tubectomy • Vasectomy: Vas deferens is tied up or removed through a small incision in the scrotum • Tubectomy: A small part of the fallopian tube is tied up or removed through a small incision in the abdomen or the vagina. These methods are highly effective but their reversibility is very poor. Contraceptive methods help in checking population explosion. However different methods of contraception may also have some side effects like nausea, abdominal pain, breakthrough bleeding, irregular menstruation, breast cancer, etc. 4.3: Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP): Termination of pregnancy before the completion of full term intentionally or voluntarily is called medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) or induced abortion. MTP has a significant role in decreasing population though it is not meant for that purpose. The Government of India legalised MTP in 1971 with some strict provisions to prevent its misuse. Why MTP? • To prevent unwanted pregnancies • In cases where continuation of pregnancy is harmful or even fatal to the mother or foetus or both. MTPs are safe in the first trimester. However MTPs during the second trimester are riskier. A dangerous trend is that MTPs are performed by quacks or unqualified doctors which may turn fatal for mother. Also use of amniocentesis or other methods of pre-natal sex determination may lead to female foeticide as the preference for male child is very high. 4.4: Sexually Transmitted Diseases: Diseases or infections of the reproductive tract which are transmitted through sexual activities and intercourse are called sexually transmitted diseases (STD) or venereal diseases (VD) or reproductive tract infections (RTI) . Gonorrhoea, syphilis, genital herpes, chlamydiasis, genital warts, trichomoniasis, hepatitis-B, HIV leading to AIDS are some of the common STDs. Among these, HIV infection is most dangerous. 4 ","Hepatitis-b and HIV can also be transmitted by sharing of injections or surgical implements with infected persons, transfusion of infected blood, transmission from infected mother to foetus, etc. Except for Hepatitis-B, genital herpes and HIV infections, other STDs are curable if detected early. Some common symptoms for STDs include itching, fluid discharge, slight pain, swellings, etc. Individuals may remain asymptomatic for a long time. This coupled with the stigma associated with STDs are the major reasons many STDs remain undetected. This could lead to complications later, which include pelvic inflammatory diseases (PID), abortions, still births, ectopic pregnancies, infertility or even cancer of the reproductive tract. STDs are a major threat to attaining a healthy society. Hence prevention along with early detection and cure of these diseases are given prime importance under reproductive health-care programmes. Steps to prevent STDs: • Avoid sex with unknown/multiple partners • Always use condoms during coitus • If in doubt, go to a qualified doctor for early detection and treatment for diseases. 4.5: Infertility: Infertility is the inability to produce children in spite of unprotected sexual co-habitation. Reasons could be physical, congenital, diseases, drugs, immunological or even psychological. Often female is blamed for being childless but the fault could more often than not lie with the male as well. Specialised health care units like infertility clinics could help in corrective treatment of some of these disorders. In case corrective treatments are not possible couples could be helped with Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). • In vitro Fertilisation (IVF): This involves fertilisation of gametes outside the body in conditions that mimic body conditions. The fertilised zygote is then induced to divide to form the embryo. The embryo is then transferred in to the uterus of the female. • Zygote Intra Fallopian Transfer (ZIFT): The zygote or early embryo (up to 8 blastomeres) can be transferred into the fallopian tube of the female. • Intra-Uterine Transfer (IUT): Embryos with more than 8 blastomeres can be transferred directly into the uterus • Gamete Intra Fallopian Transfer (GIFT): The ovum from the donor is collected and transferred into another female who cannot produce one but can provide conditions for fertilisation and further development. • Intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a specialised procedure that forms an embryo in the laboratory by directly injecting a sperm into the ovum. • Artificial insemination (AI) technique: In this technique, the semen collected either from the husband or a healthy donor is artificially introduced either into the vagina or into the uterus (IUI – intra-uterine insemination) of the female. All these methods require certified experts handling the procedures with high precision. They also need expensive instrumentation. Legal adoption is another good method for couples looking for parenthood. 5 ","PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION What is heredity? Heredity is a process of transmission of traits from parents to their offspring’s either via asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction. These characteristics or traits are located on the chromosomes in the form of genes. Gregor Johann Mendel is known as- “Father of genetics” . He proposed 3 main laws which are known as Mendel’s laws. Mendel’s Experiment Mendel’s perform a set of experiment on Garden pea using seven contrasting characters. He selected the characters that has two opposing traits. He conducted these hybridization experiment on 14 true-breeding pea plant varieties. Fig.1. Seven contrasting characters selected by Mendel Mendel’s laws There were 3 laws that were proposed by Mendel- 1. Law of dominance - The dominant allele masks the effect of recessive allele. Only dominant allele expresses its phenotype. “For example: Allele for tallness is dominant over allele for dwarfism”. 2. Law of segregation of genes - Individuals possesses two alleles of a gene and each allele separates or segregates at the time of meiosis, that is, during the formation of gametes. The monohybrid cross for flower color in the given figure explains how segregation of gametes occurs. 1 CHAPTER 5 ","Fig.2. Example of law of segregation of alleles. In this R is dominant over r. 3. Law of independent assortment – It states that alleles for separate traits are passed independently from parents to the offspring. Mendel used dihybrid (cross of two different traits) cross in order to explain independent assortment. Fig. 3. Law of independent assortment. Yellow round is dominant to green wrinkled. Inheritance of one gene Inheritance of one gene can be explained using Mendel one of the hybridization experiment such as crossing between tall and dwarf plants. When the tall and dwarf plants are crossed, the resulting first hybrid generation is known as Filial progeny or first-generation progeny. Mendel observed that all the plants formed are tall. Then the F1 plants were self-pollinated and produce F2 generation. The progeny obtained has three tall plants and one dwarf. The resulting ratio is 3:1. 2 ","Incomplete dominance When the dominant allele is not completely dominant over recessive allele and the F1 hybrid forms are intermediate of the two parents, the phenomenon is called incomplete dominance. The figure given below explains when red flowers (dominant) were crossed with white flowers (recessive), the F1 generation contain flowers which are pink in color (intermediate). Fig.4. Incomplete dominance “For example: Flower color in Mirabilis jalapa , (4’O clock plant). The phenotypic and the genotypic ratio observed is 1:2:1. Multiple Allelism or Co-dominance When a gene exists in more than two allelic forms, the phenomenon is known as multiple allelism. “For example: multiple alleles are the inheritance of A, B and O blood groups in human being”. The gene for blood group occurs in three allelic forms I A , I B and i.  An individual can possess any two of these alleles.  The gene I A codes for glycoprotein A which is responsible for A blood group and gene I B codes for glycoprotein B which is responsible for blood group B. Fig.5. Multiple allelism in Blood groups 3 ","The gene ‘i’ do not produce any glycoprotein and so the person who is homozygous for it, will have O group blood. The genes I A and I B are dominant over ‘i’. I A and I B alleles are equally dominant and produce both glycoproteins A and B and the blood group is AB. Such alleles are known as co-dominant alleles. Inheritance of two genes Mendel also worked with pea plants that differ in two characters. He had chosen the color and the shape of the seed to explain the inheritance of two genes. Y represents the dominant yellow color seed color, y represents recessive green color. R represents round shape of the seed, r represents the wrinkled shape of the seed. The genotype of the parents can then be written as RRYY and rryy. The gametes RY and ry unite on fertilization to produce the F1 hybrid RrYy. Inheritance of two genes was also used to explain the Law of Independent Assortment. Based on the crosses, the F2 ratio was found to be 9:3:3:1. Fig.6. Inheritance of two genes Chromosomal theory of inheritance Chromosomal theory of inheritance is also known as Boveri-Sutton chromosome theory. According to this theory- • Genes are located at specific locations on the chromosomes. • Homologous chromosomes separate during meiosis. • Fertilization restores chromosome number to diploid condition. • Chromosomes segregate as well as assort independently. Linkage and recombination T.H. Morgan conducted different experiments to understand the process of linkage and recombination. He carried out several dihybrid crosses in Drosophila to study genes that were sex-linked. For example, Morgan hybridized yellow-bodied, 4 ","White-eyed females to brown-bodied, red-eyed males and intercrossed those F1 progeny. He observed that the two genes did not segregate independently of each other and the F2 ratio deviated very significantly from the 9:3:3:1 ratio (expected when the two genes are independent). This leads to the conclusion, that genes are linked. Such genes which are physically linked, this process is known as linkage. Recombination is defined as rearrangement of genetic material, for example by crossing over is known as recombination. It is responsible for the formation of recombinants (progeny formed by the combination of two parents). It is responsible for the variation. Fig.7. Linkage and recombination in Drosophila Sex determination Sex determination is a system that determines the development of sexual characteristics in an organism. Different organism has different types of sex determination. In insects, the mechanism of sex determination is of XO type. In this, eggs have X chromosomes, but sperms may have one X chromosome, some do not have any X chromosome. As X chromosome is determining the sex of an individuals, X chromosome is known as sex chromosomes. Chromosomes other than the sex chromosome is known as autosomes. Mammals including man has XX-XY type of sex determination. Females carry X chromosomes in their eggs whereas males have either X chromosomes or Y chromosomes. That is why females are said to be homogametic (same type of gametes) and males to be heterogametic (different types of gametes). 5 ","Fig.8. Different types of sex determination in organisms Mutation Any change in the DNA sequence is known as mutation. It causes a heritable change in the DNA. The genotype as well as phenotype will be affected due to mutation. There are different types of mutation such as frameshift mutations, deletions, insertions, substitutions, duplications, etc. Some mutations are harmful, but some are not harmful. • Frameshift mutations causes loss or addition of DNA bases which changes the reading frame. • Addition of DNA bases is known as insertions. • Removal of DNA bases is known as deletions. • A piece of DNA, if copied more than one time is known as duplications. Thus, these mutations change the DNA sequence which ultimately leads to the formation of wrong protein. Genetic disorders Pedigree analysis Charts used to understand the inheritance pattern in a family, is known as pedigree. It is also used to find out the genetic disorders in the family also. All the family members are mapped in the form of a tree. Mendelian disorders Genetic disorders are grouped into two categories- Mendelian disorders and chromosomal disorders. Mendelian disorders are based on alteration or mutation in the single gene. Most common of these are Hemophilia, Cystic fibrosis, Sickle-cell 6 ","anemia, Color blindness, Phenylketonuria, Thalassemia, etc.  Such Mendelian disorders can be dominant or recessive. Trait can also be linked to sex chromosome, such as hemophilia and color blindness. Chromosomal disorders When disorders are caused due to absence or excess or abnormal arrangement of one or more chromosomes. Improper segregation of chromatids during cell division cycle results in the gain or loss of a chromosome(s), called aneuploidy. For example, Down’s syndrome results in the gain of extra copy of chromosome 21. Similarly, Turner’s syndrome results due to loss of an X chromosome in human females. Absence of cytokinesis after telophase stage of cell division results in an increase in a whole set of chromosomes in an organism and, this phenomenon is known as polyploidy. This condition is often seen in plants. - 7 ","Molecular Basis of Inheritance The DNA DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is double helical structure that was cracked by Watson and Crick based on the X-ray crystallography results. Each strand of a DNA helix is composed of repeating units of nucleotides. Nucleotide consists of 3 components: ribose or deoxyribose sugar, nitrogenous base (purines or pyrimidines) and phosphate. Fig.1. Structure of nucleotide There are two types of purines- adenine and guanine. Pyrimidines are of three types- thymine, cytosine, and uracil. All nucleotides are common in DNA and RNA. But uracil is found in RNA and thymine is present only in DNA. DNA is negatively charged due to the presence of negatively charged phosphate groups. A nitrogenous base is linked to the pentose sugar through the N-glycosidic linkage. Two nucleotides are linked through 3'-5' phosphodiester linkage to form a dinucleotide. A polymer formed in such a manner has a free phosphate group at 5'-end of ribose sugar, which is referred to as 5’ -end of polynucleotide chain. The other end of the polymer has a free 3'-OH group of the ribose sugar. This is referred to as 3'-end of the polynucleotide chain. The bonding between sugar and phosphates forms the backbone of a polynucleotide chain. The nitrogenous bases are linked to sugar moiety and project from the backbone. The salient feature of the double helix structure of DNA are as follows- • Two polynucleotides chains wrap around each other, where the backbone is constituted by sugar-phosphate, and bases project inside. • The two DNA chains are antiparallel to each other. It means, if one chain has the polarity 5'-3', the other has 3'-5'. 1 Chapter 6 ","• The bases in the two strands are paired through hydrogen bonding forming base pairs. Adenine form two hydrogen bonds with thymine whereas cytosine form three hydrogen bond with guanine. • The two strands are coiled in right handed pattern. • The plane of one base pair stacks over the other in double helix. This, in addition to H-bonds, confers stability of the helical structure. Packaging of DNA helix Positively charged basic proteins that surround the DNA is known as histones. Histones are rich in basic amino acids such as lysine and arginine. Histones are organized to form a unit of eight molecules called as histone octamer. The DNA is negatively charged and is packaged by wrapping around the positively charged histone octamer. This forms a structure called nucleosome. A nucleosome typically contains 200 base pairs of DNA helix. Nucleosomes form the repeating unit of a structure called chromatin in nucleus. Chromatin are thread-like stained bodies seen in nucleus. The nucleosomes in chromatin appear as ‘ beads-on-string’ structure when viewed under electron microscope (EM). The beads-on-string structure in chromatin is packaged to form chromatin fibers that are further coiled and condensed at metaphase stage of cell division to form chromosomes. At higher levels chromatin packaging requires additional proteins. These proteins are the Non-Histone Chromosomal (NHC) proteins . In a typical nucleus, loosely packed region of chromatin stains light and are referred to as euchromatin . The densely chromatin stains dark are called as Heterochromatin . Euchromatin is said to be transcriptionally active chromatin, whereas heterochromatin is inactive. Fig.2. Packaging of DNA helix DNA as a genetic material Griffith performed an experiment known as transforming experiment. He used two strains of Pneumococcus. These two different strains were used to infect the mice. The two strains used were type III-S (smooth), that contains outer capsule made up of polysaccharide and type II-R (rough) strain do not contain capsule. The capsule protects the bacteria from the host immune system. 2 ","Fig.3. Griffith experiment The Griffith experiment is explained below- • Rough strain of Pneumococcus is injected in mouse. The mouse is alive. • Smooth strain of Pneumococcus is injected in mouse. The mouse dies. • When heat killed smooth strain of Pneumococcus is injected into mouse, the mouse is alive. • In the last set of experiment, rough strain and heat killed smooth strain is injected into mouse. The mouse dies. This proves that there is some transforming substance present in heat killed S strain that is converting or transforming the rough strain into virulent strain that is responsible for the death of the mouse. This transforming substance is was later found to be DNA. The genetic material is DNA Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase (1952) performed an experiment to prove that DNA is the genetic material. They worked on bacteriophages, which are viruses that infects the bacteria. When the bacteriophage attaches to the bacteria, its genetic material enters into the bacterial cell. The viral genetic material uses the bacterial cell to synthesize more viral particles. Hershey and Chase grew some viruses on a medium that contained radioactive phosphorus and other medium that contained radioactive sulfur. When radioactive phosphorus was present in the medium the viruses contained radioactive DNA but not radioactive protein. This is because DNA contains phosphorus, but protein does not. Similarly, when the growth medium contained radioactive sulfur the viruses contained radioactive protein but not radioactive DNA. This is because DNA does not contain sulfur. 3 ","Fig.4. Hershey and chase experiment Those bacteria were found to be radioactive only when they were infected with viruses that had radioactive DNA. This indicates that DNA was the material that passed from the virus to the bacteria. Bacteria infected with viruses containing radioactive proteins were not radioactive. This indicates that proteins did not enter the bacteria from the viruses. DNA is therefore the genetic material that is passed from virus to bacteria. This experiment proves that DNA is the genetic material. Central dogma of molecular biology It is an explanation about how the flow of genetic information occurs in a biological system. This explains how DNA replicates and then gets converted into messenger RNA (mRNA) via transcription. Then this mRNA is translated to form proteins. Fig.5. Central dogma of molecular biology 4 ","DNA replication DNA replication is a process of producing two identical copies of DNA from a single DNA molecule. It is a process of biological inheritance. DNA is a double helix in which two strands are complementary to each other. These two strands of a helix separate at the time of replication to form two new DNA molecules. Out of the two strands of DNA formed, one is identical to one of the strand and another strand is complementary to the parent strand. This form of replication is known as semi-conservative replication . Before the cell enters the mitosis, the DNA is replicated in S phase of interphase. DNA polymerase in the most important enzyme involved in DNA replication. DNA replication is an energy dependent process. During the process of replication, the two DNA strands does not separate completely, the replication occur within the small opening of the DNA helix known as replication fork . The DNA polymerase catalyze the reaction in 5’ to 3’. Consequently, on one strand (the template with polarity 3'-5'), the replication is continuous, while on the other (the template with polarity 5'-3'), it is discontinuous. The enzyme DNA ligase later joins the discontinuously synthesized fragments. The strand which is synthesized continuously is known as leading strand whereas the one synthesized discontinuously is known as lagging strand . Replication begins on the specific site on the DNA, known as origin of replication . Fig.6. DNA replication Transcription It is a process of formation of RNA such as messenger RNA from DNA before gene expression or protein synthesis occurs. During transcription, one of the strand of DNA acts as template for mRNA formation. The synthesis of mRNA occurs via RNA polymerase enzyme. Transcription usually occurs for a particular DNA segment which is required further for gene 5 ","expression. Other than the messenger RNA, other forms of RNA such as ribosomal RNA, micro RNA, small nuclear RNA can also be transcribed in the similar manner. A transcription unit in DNA consists of following three regions- a promoter, structural gene and a terminator . DNA dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the polymerization in 5’ -3’ direction. Promoter is the region where RNA polymerase binds. Terminator defines the end of transcription. Fig.7. Process of transcription Transcription consists of three steps- initiation, elongation and termination . Initiation involves the binding of the RNA polymerase to promoter. Single type of DNA dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of all types of RNA in bacteria. Elongation is the process of addition of nucleotides to form the RNA. Termination factor helps in termination of transcription. The RNA synthesized after transcription is known as primary transcript. The primary transcript undergoes modification such as splicing, capping, tailing etc. Primary transcript consist of introns and exons. The removal of introns is known as splicing . Addition of poly-A tail at the 3’ -end of the RNA is known as tailing . In capping an unusual nucleotide (methyl guanosine triphosphate) is added to the 5'-end of RNA. Some viruses have a property of reverse transcription. They are able to convert RNA template into DNA. The enzyme used is known as reverse transcriptase. “For example: Human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS”. Translation This is the process of gene expression or protein synthesis that occurs in cytosol. Ribosomes are the cell organelles that are involved in protein synthesis. The messenger RNA formed by the process of transcription is decoded by ribosomes to form a polypeptide made up of amino acids. Messenger RNA is composed of polymer of nucleotides or codon . Each codon 6 ","consists of 3 nucleotides that will code for a single amino acid. There are some important components that are involved in protein synthesis- ribosomes, messenger RNA and transfer RNA (tRNA). Transfer RNA is involved in physically linking mRNA and the amino acid sequence of proteins. Fig.8. Translation set-up It involves 4 main steps- • Activation of amino acids- amino acids binds to specific tRNA molecule. • Initiation of polypeptide synthesis- In capping an unusual nucleotide (methyl guanosine triphosphate) is added to the 5'-end of RNA • Elongation of polypeptide synthesis- It involves the addition of amino acids to the growing polypeptide chains • Termination of polypeptide synthesis- It involves the end of the translation of protein synthesis. Genetic code The set of rules by which information encoded in genetic material is translated into proteins in the living cells. Salient features of genetic code are as follows- • The codon consists of three nucleotides. 61 codons code for 20 different amino acids. • One codon codes for one amino acid. • One amino acid can be coded by more than one codon. 7 ","Fig.9. Genetic code • The code is universal. Regulation of gene expression All the genes in the living cells is not active all the time. They become active when needed. Expression is controlled by genes are known as regulatory genes. Regulation in eukaryotes can occur at the following levels- • Transcriptional level. • Processing level. • Transport of mRNA from nucleus to the cytoplasm. • Translational level. Lac operon or lactose operon An operon consists of structural genes, operator genes, promoter genes, promoter genes, regulator genes, and repressor. Lac operon consist of lac Z, lac Y and lac A genes. Lac Z codes for galactosidase, lac Y codes for permease and lac A codes for transacetylase. When repressor molecules bind the operator, genes are not transcribed. When repressor does not bind the operator and instead inducer binds, transcription is switched on. In case of lac operon, lactose is an inducer. So, binding of lactose to operator, switch on the transcription. 8 ","Fig.10. Lactose operon Human genome project The salient features of the human genome project are as follows- • The human genome contains 3164.7 million nucleotide bases. • The average gene consists of 3000 bases, but size varies. • Humans are said to have about 30,000 genes. • The functions are unknown for over 50 per cent of the discovered genes. • Less than 2 per cent of the genome codes for proteins. • Human genome consists of large portion of repeated sequences. • Chromosome 1 has most genes (2968), and the Y has the fewest (231). 9 ","Evolution • Evolutionary biology is the study of history of life forms on the Earth. • To understand the evolution in flora and fauna over a period of millions of years on the earth, we must understand the origin of life beginning with the evolution of the earth, of stars, and the universe itself. • Origin of life is believed to be a unique event in the history of universe. • The Big Bang Theory attempts to explain to us the origin of universe. The Big Bang theory: • A singular huge explosion of very dense matter from a point of singularity. • This caused the universe to expand and the temperature to fall drastically. • After some time hydrogen and helium were formed. • The gases condensed due to gravitation. They later formed the galaxies in the universe. The Earth is believed to have been formed about 4.5 billion years back in the solar system of the Milky Way galaxy. Condition of early earth: • The Earth formed 4.5 billion years back. • There was no atmosphere on early earth. • Water vapor, methane, carbon dioxide and ammonia released from molten mass covered the surface. The UV rays from the sun caused decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen gas being lighter escaped into space. • Oxygen that remained behind combined with ammonia and methane to form water, CO2 and other compounds. • The ozone layer was formed. • As the water vapor cooled, it fell as rain, to fill all the depressions and form oceans. • Life appeared around 500 Million years after the earth was formed. Origin of Life (theories): • Early Greek believed that units of life called spores were brought to different planets including earth. This theory is called as Panspermia and is still a favored by many astronomers. • For a long time it was also believed that life could originate from decaying and rotting matter like straw, mud etc. • This was the theory of spontaneous generation. It was disproved by Louis Pasteur by his swan-neck flask experiment. Louis Pasteur experiment: • Careful experimentation demonstrated that life comes only from pre-existing life. • He showed that in flasks that were sterilized prior to the experiment, life did not originate from killed yeast. At the same time, if a similar flask was left open to air, new living organism arose from “killed yeast”. • This disproved the theory of spontaneous generation. 1 Chapter 7 ","Swan Neck Flask experiment to disprove spontaneous generation Oparin – Haldane theory of origin of life: • Oparin of Russia and Haldane of England proposed that the first forms of life originated from pre- existing non-living organic molecules (e.g. RNA, protein etc.). • Formation of life was preceded by chemical evolution i.e. formation of diverse organic molecule from inorganic constituents. • In 1953, S.L. Miller, an American scientist demonstrated the same experimentally in a laboratory scale Urey and Miller Experiment: • The Conditions of the Earth were – o High Temperature. o Volcanic Storms. o Reducing atmosphere containing CH 4 , NH 3 etc. • In 1953 S.L.Miller an American scientist created similar conditions in laboratory scale. o To simulate conditions of primitive earth he created electric discharge in a closed flask. This raised the temperature up to 800 o C. o Used CH 4 , H 2 , NH 3 and water vapor inside the flask. • He observed the formation of amino acids 2 ","Acceptance of chemical evolution theory: (evidences): • Miller observed the synthesis of amino acids from simple inorganic chemicals. He did this by recreating the conditions that were believed to exist on primitive earth in the laboratory. • In similar experiments formation of sugars, nitrogen bases, pigment and fats were also observed by other scientists. • Analysis of meteorite content showed the presence of similar compounds. This indicates that similar processes are occurring elsewhere in space. Theory of Origin of Species by Natural Selection:- • In observations made during a sea voyage in a sail ship called H.M.S. Beagle round the world, Charles Darwin concluded that existing life forms share similarities to varying degrees not only among themselves but also with life forms that millions of years ago. • Many such life forms don’t exist anymore. Due to various reasons there have been extinctions of different life forms in the past. There also have been the emergence of new forms of life at different periods of history of earth. • There has been gradual evolution of life forms. • All populations of organisms have variations in characteristics. • Individuals with characteristics that allow better adaptability survive better in natural conditions (climate, food, physical factors, etc.)  and would therefore outbreed others with less favorable characteristics. This ensures that the survival of the variety that is most adaptable to change. It leads to the survival and propagation of the fittest organisms in the population as it can survive and outlast change. • Survival of the fittest : The fitness according to Darwin refers ultimately to the ability to survive a change. Therefore only the fittest organisms survive and produce more progeny then others. • These, therefore, have better survival capacities and hence are selected by nature. He called it as natural selection. • Alfred Wallace, a naturalist who worked in Malay Archipelago had also come to similar conclusions around the same time. • The geological history of earth is closely related to the biological history of earth. 3 ","Family tree of dinosaurs WHAT ARE EVIDENCES FOR EVOLUTION? Paleontological evidence: • Fossils are remains of hard parts of life-forms found in rocks. • Different-aged rock sediments contain fossils of different life-forms who probably died during the formation of the particular sediment. • They represent the extinct organisms (e.g. Dinosaurs). • A study of different sedimentary layers in which fossils were present indicates the geological period in which they existed. • The study showed that life-forms varied over time and certain life forms are restricted to certain geological time-span. • Hence new forms of life are believed to have originated at different times in the history of earth. • All this called Paleontological evidence . Comparative anatomy and morphological evidence: • Comparative anatomy and morphology shows similarities and differences among organisms of today and those that existed years ago. Divergent evolution: • Different mammals like bats, whales, cheetah and humans share similarities in the pattern of bones of forelimbs. • These forelimbs perform different functions in these animals but they have similar anatomical structure – all of them have humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals and phalanges in their forelimbs. • Thus it can be seen that the same structure developed along different directions due to adaptation to different needs. • This direction of evolution is called as divergent evolution and these structures are homologous to each other. 4 ","• Homology indicates common ancestry. • Other examples of homologous organ are vertebrate hearts and brains. • Thorn of Bougainvillea and tendrils of Cucurbita represent homology. Homologous organs: Forelimbs of mammals Homologous organs in Plants Convergent Evolution: • Wings of butterfly and of birds both appear similar. • Anatomically they do not have similar structure though they perform similar function. • Hence analogous structures are a result of convergent evolution . • Eyes of different organisms like that of octopus of mammals. • Flippers of Penguins and Dolphins. • Sweet potato (root modification) and potato (stem modification) for storage of food. 5 ","Biochemical evidences: • Similarities in proteins and genes performing a specific function among different organisms give clues regarding common ancestry. Embryological support for evolution: • Ernst Heckel proposed this evidence as evolution based on observation of certain common features during embryonic stage of all vertebrates but are absent in adult. • All vertebrate embryos including human embryo develop a row of vestigial gill slits just behind the head. It is seen that it is a functional organ only in fish. Gills are not found in any other adult vertebrates. • The embryological evidence was disregarded and disproved by Karl Ernst von Baer on the basis of careful study performed by him. He noted that the similarities in embryos never pass through the adult stages of other animals. Evolution by natural selection: • A popular example is the change in frequency of moth population in England in 1850. • Before industrialization set in more white-winged moths were observed on trees than dark winged or melanised moths. • After industrialization i.e . 1920, the proportion was reversed as there were more dark-winged moths in the same area. Evolution by anthropogenic action: • Excess use of herbicides, pesticides etc., has resulted in selection of the resistant varieties in a much lesser time scale. 6 ","• This has also been observed for microbes against which we use antibiotics or drugs. • Hence resistance in organisms/cells are now appearing in a time scale of months or years and not in centuries. • These are the examples of evolution by anthropogenic action. • Evolution is a stochastic process. This is because it is based on random and chance events in nature and chance mutation in the organisms. WHAT IS ADAPTIVE RADIATION? Darwin’s Finches: • Darwin’s theory was based on observation of certain birds i n the Galapagos Islands. The small black birds he observed have since been called Darwin’s Finche s. • He observed that there were many varieties of finches in the same island. • All the varieties he came across had evolved on the island itself. • They were originally adapted with seed-eating features. From these many other forms evolved with altered beaks depending on the food habit. This enabled them to become insectivorous and vegetarian finches • This process of evolution of different species in a given geographical area starting from a point and radiating to other areas of geography is called as adaptive radiation. Australian marsupial: • In Australia it was seen that a number of marsupials had evolved from an ancestral stock. These marsupials were all different from each other. • When more than one adaptive radiation appears to have occurred in an isolated geographical area (representing different habitats), it can be called as convergent evolution. • Placental mammals in Australia were also seen to exhibit adaptive radiation. They seem to be evolved from a marsupial into various placental mammals. The placental mammals are showed similarities to the ancestral marsupial (e.g. placental wolf and Tasmanian wolf-marsupial). 7 ","BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION: • Natural selection is the essence of Darwinian Theory about evolution. • The rate of appearance of new forms is related to the life cycle or the life span. • For variations to get selected and evolve there has to be a genetic basis. • Organisms with favorable variations are better adapted to survive in a hostile environment. • Variations result in adaptability. They have a genetic basis and are therefore inherited. • Fitness is the ability to adapt to changing environment and thus get selected by the nature. • The key concepts of Darwinism are: ➢ Natural selection: Survival of the fittest by the nature in face of changing environment. ➢ Theory of Common Descent: Organisms are descended from common ancestors due to accumulation of variations Lamarck theory of evolution: (theory of inheritance of acquired characters) • French Naturalist Lamarck proposed that evolution of life forms occurs due to use and disuse of organs. • He explained this theory using giraffes as an example. He claimed that giraffes formed long necks in an attempt to forage leaves on tall trees. Therefore, this character was acquired based on a need to adapt and survive • This acquired character was passed to succeeding generations. • Giraffes, therefore, came to develop long necks slowly over the course of many years. MECHANISM OF EVOLUTION: • Hugo de Vries worked on evening primrose. He gave the idea of mutations . 8 ","• Mutation is the difference arising suddenly in a population. Hugo de Vries theory of mutation differs from Darwin ’s theory of natural selection. • He stated that mutation causes evolution and not the minor variations that as suggested by Darwin. • Mutations are sudden, random and directionless while Darwinian variations are small and directional. • Evolution according to Darwin was slow and gradual whereas Hugo de Vries believed that mutation caused large changes that led to speciation. He therefore called it saltation (single step large mutation). • Saltation: It is a large and an abrupt evolutionary change that has been brought about due to sudden large scale mutation. HARDY – WEINBERG PRINCIPLE: • For given population the frequency of occurrence of alleles of a particular gene present on a specific locus can be calculated. • This frequency is usually fixed and remains the same throughout different generations. • Hardy-Weinberg principle expressed the same using algebraic equations. This is called as the Hardy-Weinberg Principle. • The principle states that allele frequencies in a population are stable and are constant from generation to generation. • The gene pool (total genes and their alleles in a population) remains a constant. This is called genetic equilibrium . • Sum total of all the allelic frequencies is 1. • The principle can be represented mathematically as follows: • (p + q) 2 = p 2 + 2pq + q 2 = 1. • p and q represent the individual allele frequencies. • Therefore, p 2 = frequency of homozygous condition represented by p And q 2 = frequency of homozygous alleles represented by q And pq = frequency of heterozygous condition • Difference in values of p, q and pq indicate the extent of evolutionary change. • Disturbance in genetic equilibrium (Hardy Weinberg equilibrium) or change of frequency of alleles in a population can then be interpreted as accumulation or change in variations that results in evolution. • Five factors are known to affect Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium : O Gene migration or gene flow. O Genetic drift. O Mutation. O Genetic recombination. O Natural selection. • Gene migration: When a section of population migrates to another place gene frequencies will change in the original as well as in the new population. New genes /alleles will be added to the new population and the same are lost from the old population. • Gene flow: When gene migration occurs frequently it is termed as gene flow. • Genetic drift: Change in gene frequency that occurs due to a random event or by chance. 9 ","• Founder effect: Sometimes the change in allelic frequency is so drastic that in the new sample of population the variants form a different species. The original drifted population from which the variants arose becomes founder species and this effect is called founder effect . Operation of natural selection on different trait: • Natural selection can lead to : o Stabilization: In which more individuals acquire mean character value. o Directional changes : Occurs when more individuals acquire value other than the mean character value. o Disruption: more individuals acquire peripheral character value at both ends of the distribution curve. A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF EVOLUTION: • Approximately 2000 million years ago (mya) the first forms of life appeared on earth. They were cellular • Certain cellular forms developed the ability to photosynthesize and thus release O2. The atmosphere slowly became rich in oxygen. This in turn promoted the development and evolution of more aerobic forms of organisms. • Slowly and gradually the single cell organisms started to form multi-cellular life forms. • Around 500 mya invertebrates were formed. • The first fish evolved from invertebrates around 350 mya. They were probably jawless fish. • At around 320 mya sea weeds and few plants evolved and existed. • Coelacanth a lobe finned fish was discovered in South Africa in 1938. It is believed to have evolved into the first amphibious organisms that lived on both land and water. These amphibians were the ancestors of modern day frogs and salamanders. • The amphibians slowly and gradually evolved into reptiles . • Reptile eggs do not dry up in sun unlike those of amphibians. • Giant ferns (Pteridophytes) present on land fell and got buried in soil. As more sediments accumulated on top they started to form coal deposits slowly. • Some of the reptiles retreated back into water to evolve into fish like reptiles probably 200 mya 10 ","( Ichthyosaurs ). • The biggest land reptiles were the dinosaurs. • The largest dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex was about 20 feet in height and had huge fearsome dagger like teeth. • About 65 mya the dinosaurs suddenly underwent mass extinction from the earth. Some of them evolved into birds. • The first mammals were small and shrew-like. They had small sized fossils. • Mammals evolved to become viviparous. This protected their unborn young inside the mother’s body. • Pouched mammals of Australia survived because of lack of competition from any other mammals. This lack of competition was a result of Continental Drift. 11 ","ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF MAN: • About 15 mya primates such as Dryopithecus and Ramapithecus existed. They appeared to be similar to gorillas and chimpanzees in their appearance and walking. • Ramapithecus was more similar to man whereas Dryopithecus was more similar to apes. • Few fossils of bones that resemble human bones have been discovered in Ethiopia and Tanzania. • Two mya Australopithecines existed. They most likely lived in East African grasslands. o They used stone weapons for hunting. o Essentially had a fruit-based diet. • The first human-like organism was the hominid and was called Homo habilis. o Brain capacity was 650 – 800 cc. o They also survived on plant-based diet and did not eat meat. • Fossils discovered in Java in 1891 seemed to be of the next stage i.e. Homo erectus . They evolved about 1.5 mya. o Had large brain with capacity around 900 cc. o Probably ate meat. • Neanderthal man: o Brain size was around 1400 cc. o Lived in east and central Asia between 1, 00,000-40,000 years back. o They developed use of animal hides to protect their body. o Buried their dead. • Homo sapiens: o Arose in Africa and migrated across continents and developed distinct races. o During ice age 75,000-10,000 years ago modern Homo sapiens arose. o Pre historic cave art developed about 18,000 years ago. o Agriculture came around 10,000 years back and human settlement started.

Factors Affecting Our Health 1. Our dietary habits: A person eating a well balanced diet containing adequate amounts of nutrients required by our body on daily basis is healthier than a person taking nutritionally deficient diet. 2 . Lifestyle : A person having a sedentary lifestyle is less healthy than a person doing moderate amount of physical activity. 3. Our social environment : A person living under stressful social environment with lot of antisocial activities are always under stressful mental conditions and more prone to stress related disorders as compared to a person living in relaxed environment. 4. The kind the work that we do to earn our living : People working in the factories or environment with air or noise pollution will get respiratory and hearing problems respectively. 5. State of the mind: Affects the neural system and endocrine system which in turn affects our immune system. State of the immune system has a vital role to play in keeping us in a healthy state. 6. Genetic information : Genetic information inherited from parents can be cause of many physical abnormalities and some genetic diseases can be passed on from parents to the offspring. 7. Our physical environment : People living in clean areas with a proper garbage and sewage disposal system in place and lot of greenery are healthier than people living under unhygienic conditions and areas lacking greenery. 8. Economic conditions of individual: affects the health by affecting the buying capacity and also amount of the money spend by the individuals on health. Disease Definition – A state when the functioning of one or more organs of the body is affected resulting in altered physiological state with signs and symptoms telling us that there is something wrong with our health, it is called as disease. Diseases can be classified as Infectious and Non infectious Diseases Infectious Diseases – Diseases which are easily transmitted from one person to another are called infectious diseases. They are caused by pathogens. Examples include Common cold, malaria, AIDS Non infectious Diseases – Disease which cannot be transmitted from one person to another are called non – infectious diseases. Examples – Cancer and Diabetes. Pathogens: Organisms that cause diseases in a host are called pathogens. They are usually microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, viruses, etc. Widal test: It is a serological test that can be used for detecting typhoid. 1 CHAPTER 8 ","Disease caused by Bacteria Disease Name of Bacteria Mode of transmission Symptoms Typhoid fever Salmonella typhi Contaminated food and water Sustained high fever Stomach pain Weakness Constipation Loss of appetite (in severe cases – Intestinal perforations and death ) Pneumonia Streptococcus pneumoniae/ Haemophilus influenzae Sharing of glasses and utensils , inhaling droplet nuclei Alveoli of lungs get infected leading to respiratory problems ,fever , chills ,cough and headache (lips and nails become grey in severe cases ) Disease caused by Viruses Disease Name of Viruses Mode of transmission Symptoms Common Cold Rhino Virus Air – through droplet nuclei, and through contaminated objects. Infection of nose and respiratory tract. Nasal congestion and discharge, hoarseness, cough headache tiredness Disease caused by protozoa Disease Name of Protozoa Mode of transmission Symptoms Malaria Plasmodium (P.falciparum ,P.vivax, P. malaria ) By vector (Female Anopheles mosquito) High fever and chills at fixed time interval due to release of haemozoin after rupture of infected RBC’s. Amoebiasis (amoebic dysentery) Entamoeba histolytica Houseflies act as mechanical carriers) serve to transmit the p arasite from faeces of infected person to food (faeco-oral transmission constipation, abdominal pain and cramps, stools with excess mucous and blood clots 2 ","Stages in the life cycle of Plasmodium Life Cycle of Plasmodium: 1. Sporozoites: The infectious form of Plasmodium which enters the human body through the bite of a female Anopheles mosquito. 2. Multiplication of parasites inside the liver cells. 3. Attack of the RBCs by the parasites causing the rupture of the RBCs. 4. Release of a toxic substance called haemozoin by the ruptured RBCs that causes chills and recurring fevers every three to four days. 5. Transfer of the parasites into the body of the female Anopheles mosquito when the infected person is bitten by the mosquito. 6. Multiplication of the parasites within the mosquito to form sporozoites. These sporozoites are stored in the salivary glands of the mosquito. 7. The infected mosquito bites an uninfected person and the cycle repeats. • It is important to note that the malarial parasite Plasmodium requires two hosts to complete its life cycle- the human host and the female Anopheles mosquito. Diseases caused by worms: Disease Pathogen Mode of Transmission Symptoms Ascariasis Ascaris Faeco-oral transmission Fever, anaemia, muscular pain, internal bleeding and blockage of intestinal passage. Elephantiasis/Filariasis Wuchereria bancrofti, W.malayi Bite of female mosquito vectors Chronic inflammation of lymphatic vessels of lower limbs and genital organs causing gross deformities. Diseases caused by Fungi Ringworm Microsporum, Trichophyton, Epidermophyton Direct contact through soil, contaminated clothes, combs, etc. Dry, scaly lesions on skin, nails and scalp accompanied by intense itching. Symptoms 3 ","worsen with increased heat and moisture Prevention and Control: 1. Maintenance of personal and public hygiene 2. Isolation and Quarantine 3. Elimination of vectors and their breeding places 4. Protection against vectors 5. Vaccination 6. Antibiotics 8.2: IMMUNITY The ability of the host to fight and protect against disease-causing organisms conferred by the immune system is called immunity. Immunity is of two types: (i) Innate immunity (ii) Acquired immunity . 8.2.1 Innate Immunity Innate immunity is a non-specific type of immunity in an individual that is present at the time of birth. It works by preventing the entry of pathogens through various barriers. There are various types of barriers by which the body prevents the entry of the foreign agents into our body. Innate immunity consist of four types of barriers. These are — (i) Physical barriers Examples - Skin, Mucus coating of the epithelium lining the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts (ii) Physiological barriers : Acid in the stomach, saliva in the mouth, tears from eyes (iii) Cellular barriers : Certain types of leukocytes (WBC) of our body can phagocytose and destroy microbes. For example, the polymorpho-nuclear leukocytes (PMNL-neutrophils), monocytes, natural killer (type of lymphocytes) in the blood, as well as macrophages in tissues. (iv) Cytokine barriers : Cells infected with a virus secrete certain special proteins called as interferons which protect other non-infected cells from further viral infection . 8.2.2: Acquired Immunity This type of immunity is pathogen specific and is characterized by a memory .When the pathogen is encountered for the first time a low intensity primary response is produced. Subsequent encounters with the same pathogen produces a high intensity response with the help of memory cells. This is called secondary or anamnestic response. Primary and secondary response are carried out with the help of 2 special types of lymphocytes B- lymphocytes and T lymphocytes. B- Lymphocytes produce special proteins called antibodies whereas the T lymphocytes help B-lymphocytes to produce antibodies. Antibody Structure Each antibody has 2 light chains and 2 heavy chains. 4 ","It is represented as H 2 L 2 . Antibodies in our bodies are of different types such as IgA, IgG, IgE, and IgM. Humoral Immune response It is the kind of immune response that involve production of antibodies as these antibodies are present in the blood (body humor) Cell -mediated immunity It is an immune response that does not involve antibodies, but rather involves the activation of phagocytes, antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, and the release of various cytokines in response to an antigen. The body is able to differentiate ‘self’ and ‘non -self’ and the cell -mediated immune response is responsible for the graft rejection. 8.2.3: Active immunity v/s Passive immunity Active immunity. Passive immunity When a host is exposed to antigens, which may be in the form of living or dead microbes or other proteins, antibodies are produced in the host body. This type of immunity is called active immunity. When ready-made antibodies are directly given to protect the body against foreign agents, it is called passive immunity. Effective after a lag period This type of immunity is immediately effective after antibodies are given Memory cells are produced which can produce stronger response the next time body encounters same antigen. Memory cells are not produced and there is no long term protection provided to the body. Examples – Vaccines like BCG, MMR Examples – Anti-Tetanus injection ,Injections for snake bite, colostrum(yellowish fluid produced by the mother in the initial days of lactation) contains abundant IgA antibodies to protect the infant against infections 5 ","8.2.4: Vaccination and Immunization: Vaccination: It is the introduction of antigenic proteins of pathogens or part or whole of inactivated or weakened pathogens into the host body so as to trigger the host immune system to produce antibodies against the antigens. Vaccination works on the principle of memory. The antibodies produced in response to the vaccine will then help the body fight against the actual infection. During the actual infection these antibodies will be produced in large amounts by the activation of memory B and T cells of the immune system which will recognize the antigen and form the suitable antibodies faster. In some cases, if a person has been severely infected or needs antibodies in his body faster to fight the infection readymade antibodies may be introduced into his body. This is called as passive immunization . This method is employed when time is insufficient to activate the host immune system so as to produce the required antibodies. Newer techniques like recombinant DNA technology allows the production of antigenic polypeptides in bacteria and yeast. This allows for large scale manufacture of vaccines against specific antigenic polypeptides of various pathogens. As the cellular material of the pathogen is not present in the vaccine, the side effects to the vaccine may also be lesser in these cases. 8.2.5: Allergies Definition: The aggravated response of the immune system to certain antigens present in the environment is called allergy. The substances to which such an immune response is produced are called allergens . The antibodies produced to these are of IgE type. Common examples of allergens are mites in dust, pollens, animal dander, etc. Symptoms of allergic reactions include sneezing, watery eyes, running nose and difficulty in breathing. Allergy is due to the release of chemicals like histamine and serotonin from the mast cells. Drugs like anti-histamines, adrenalin and steroids act quickly to reduce the symptoms of allergy. Modern-day lifestyle has led to lowered immunity and increased susceptibility to allergies. 8.2.6: Auto immunity The human immune system can differentiate antigen which are foreign to the body from the antigen which are part of the body. This is called auto immunity. In some cases the body attacks its own cells due to genetic and other unknown reasons. This causes damage to the body and is called auto-immune disease. Example -Rheumatoid arthritis. 8.2.7: Immune System in the Body: It consists of: • Lymphoid organs • Tissues • Cells • Antibodies The immune system functions as follows: • It differentiates between self and non-self • It protects the body against non-self or foreign antigens 6 ","• It acts on the basis of memory and protects the body against antigens to which it has been previously exposed • It is involved in allergic reactions • It is important in auto-immune diseases • It is important in organ transplant and graft rejection. Lymphoid organs -These are the organs where origin and/or maturation and proliferation of lymphocytes occur -Lymphoid organs defend the body against foreign antigens or spread of tumors. - These organs exist as primary, secondary and tertiary. This is based on the stage of lymphocyte development and maturation the organ is involved in. -  Lymphoid organs contain connective tissues with different types of leukocytes or white blood cells. Of these, lymphocytes are usually present in the highest percentage regardless of the type of lymphoid organ The primary lymphoid organs bone marrow, thymus immature lymphocytes differentiate into antigen-sensitive lymphocytes Secondary lymphoid organs Spleen, lymph nodes, tonsils, Peyer’s patche s of small intestine and appendix provide the sites for interaction of lymphocytes with the antigen, which then proliferate to become effector cells • The bone marrow is the main lymphoid organ where all blood cells including lymphocytes are produced. • The thymus is a lobed organ. It is located beneath the breastbone and near the heart. The thymus is quite large at the time of birth but its size keeps decreasing with increase in age and by the time puberty is attained it reduces to a very small size. Both bone-marrow and thymus provide micro-environments for the development and maturation of T-lymphocytes. • The spleen is a large bean shaped organ. It mainly contains lymphocytes and phagocytes. It acts as a filter of the blood by trapping blood-borne microorganisms. Spleen also has a large reservoir of erythrocytes. • The lymph nodes are small solid structures located at different points along the lymphatic system.  Lymph nodes trap the micro-organisms or other antigens that get into the lymph and tissue fluid. Antigens that get trapped in the lymph nodes are responsible for the activation of lymphocytes present within the lymph nodes. This causes the immune response. Lymphoid tissue is also located within the lining of the major tracts (respiratory, digestive and urogenital tracts). It is called as mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT ). It forms approximately 50 per cent of the lymphoid tissue in human body 7 ","Lymphoid Organs in Human Body Lymph Nodes in Human Body 8.3: AIDS (Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome ). This refers to an acquired condition of deficiency of immune system. It is a condition acquired during the lifetime of an individual referring to the fact that it is not a congenital disease. ‘Syndrome’ means a group of symptoms . -AIDS was first reported in 1981 and in approximately the last twenty-five years, it has spread all over the world killing more than 25 million persons. Causative Agent -The Human Immuno deficiency Virus (HIV) It is a member of a group of viruses called retrovirus. They have an envelope enclosing the RNA genome. They also contain the reverse transcriptase gene. Transmission of HIV-infection (a) Sexual contact with infected person, (b) By transfusion of contaminated blood and blood products, (c) By sharing infected needles as in the case of intravenous drug abusers and (d) From infected mother to her child through placenta. 8 ","People who are at high risk of getting this infection -individuals who have multiple sexual partners -drug addicts who take drugs intravenously, -Individuals who require repeated blood transfusions (certain cancers, anemia, and thalassemia) -children born to an HIV infected mother. HIV/AIDS does not spread through mere touch or physical contact . It spreads only through contact with body fluids. It is important for the physical and psychological well-being of the infected person that the HIV/AIDS infected persons not be isolated from family and society. There always exists a sufficient time interval between the infection and appearance of symptoms. This incubation period may vary from a few months to many years (usually 5-10 years). How HIV affects the body? -The virus enters the body of the person and infects the macrophages. -The RNA genome of the virus replicates to form viral DNA with the help of the enzyme reverse transcriptase. -This viral DNA is thus incorporated into host cell’s DNA and then directs the infected cells to produce more virus particles. -The macrophages continue to produce virus. -At the same time HIV enters into helper T-lymphocytes (TH) to replicate and produce progeny viruses. -The progeny viruses released in the blood attack other helper T-lymphocytes. This entire cycle is repeated leading to a progressive decrease in the number of helper T-lymphocytes in the body of the infected person. -During this period, the person suffers from bouts of fever, diarrhea and weight loss. -Due to decrease in the number of helper T lymphocytes, the person starts suffering from infections that could have been otherwise dealt with by the immune system. This includes diseases such as those caused by bacteria especially Mycobacterium , viruses, fungi and even parasites like Toxoplasma. The patient becomes immuno-deficient and is unable to protect themselves against these infections. Detection : Enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA): It is a biochemical technique used in immunology to detect the presence of an antibody or an antigen in a sample. A western Blot test is also done to confirm results of ELISA test. 9 ","Treatment: Use anti-retroviral drugs. By this the life span of patient can be prolonged but it cannot prevent death. Prevention of AIDS: As AIDS has no cure, prevention is the best option. - Spread can be limited by conscious effort and behavior patterns. -More effective monitoring can prevent infection through blood transfusion, transmission from mother to new-born. Role of government and non government organization in limiting spread of this disease. -National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and other non-governmental organisation (NGOs) are making efforts to educate people about AIDS. -WHO conducts a number of programmes to prevent the spreading of HIV infection. Prevention and Control Methods: • Making blood transfusions safe from HIV • Ensuring the use of only disposable needles and syringes in public and private hospitals and clinics. • Free distribution of condoms • Controlling drug abuse • Advocating safe sex • Promoting regular check-ups for HIV in susceptible populations. Role of Society in preventing spread of this disease -Sympathy for HIV/AIDS patients. -Disclosure about the HIV status to prevent further spread to more people. -Co-operation and co-ordination between society and medical fraternity to prevent the spread of the disease. 8.4: Cancer -In our body, cell growth and differentiation is highly controlled and regulated. -In cancer cells, there is breakdown of these regulatory mechanisms. -Normal cells exhibit contact inhibition. Due to this contact of a cell with other cells inhibits its uncontrolled growth. -Cancer cells lose contact inhibition. As a result of this, cancerous cells continue to divide giving rise to masses of cells called tumors . Tumors are of two types: 1. Benign tumors normally remain limited to their original location and do not spread to other parts of the body. They cause less damage. 2. The malignant tumors are a mass of proliferating cells called neoplastic or tumor cells. These cells grow very rapidly. They thus invade and damage the surrounding normal tissues. As these cells are actively dividing and growing it leads to the starvation of the normal cells by competing for vital nutrients. Cells may be sloughed from such tumors and reach distant sites through blood. Wherever they get lodged in the body they cause the emergence of a new tumor. This property called metastasis. Causes of cancer: -Transformation of normal cells into cancerous neoplastic cells may be induced by physical, chemical or biological agents. These agents are called carcinogens. Common carcinogens: -Ionising radiations: X-rays and gamma rays -Non-ionizing radiations: UV Both ionizing and non-ionising radiations cause DNA damage that causes neoplastic transformation. -The chemical carcinogens present in tobacco smoke have been identified as a major cause of lung cancer. 10 ","Oncogenic viruses are cancer causing viruses. They have genes called viral oncogenes. Several genes called cellular oncogenes(c-onc) or proto oncogenes have been identified in normal cells which can be activated under certain conditions and therefore lead to oncogenic transformation of the cells. Cancer Detection and Diagnosis: Early detection of cancers is essential as it allows the disease to be treated successfully in many cases. Cancer detection is based on: - Biopsy: a piece of the suspected tissue cut into thin sections is stained -  Histopathological studies of the tissue (thin sections are examined under the microscope) - Blood and bone marrow tests: for increased cell counts in the case of leukemias. - Radiography : (use of X-rays), - CT (computed tomography) : This technique uses X-rays to generate a three-dimensional image of the internals of an object. - MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) : MRI involves use of strong magnetic fields and non-ionizing radiations to accurately detect pathological and physiological changes in the living tissue. -Antibodies against cancer-specific antigens : Used for detection of certain cancers. - Techniques of molecular biology : To detect genes in individuals with inherited susceptibility to certain cancers. Identification of such genes may be helpful in prevention of cancers. Such individuals may be advised to avoid exposure to particular carcinogens to which they are susceptible (e.g., tobacco smoke in case of lung cancer). Treatment of cancer: -Treatment of cancer can be done by one or combinations of different approaches. The common approaches for treatment of cancer are surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. -In radiotherapy, tumor cells are irradiated lethally, taking proper care of the normal tissues surrounding the tumor mass. -Several chemotherapeutic drugs are used to kill cancerous cells. These drugs may be specific for particular tumors. Most drugs have side effects like hair loss, anemia, etc. -Majority of the cancers are treated by a combination of all the above methods. -Tumor cells avoid detection and destruction by immune system. Therefore, they are treated with substances called biological response modifiers . They are substances such as α -interferon which activate their immune system and help in destroying the tumor. 8.5: Drug Abuse Drugs are chemical substances which when taken inside the body for a purpose other than the medicinal use or in amounts and frequency that impairs ones physical, psychological functions, it constitutes a drug abuse. Commonly abused drugs -opioid -cannabinoids -coca alkaloids Drug /Chemical nature Obtained from Taken by Action Opioids / Diacetylmorphine Latex of Poppy plant ( Papaver somniferum ) snorting or injection -bind specifically to the opioid receptors present in the CNS and GI tract. -Depressant and slows down body functions Cannabinoids Inflorescences of plant Cannabis sativa Oral ingestion Inhalation Has effect on cardiovascular systems of the body. 11 ","Coca alkaloids or Cocaine Coca Plant Erythroxylum coca Snorted It interferes with the transport of the neurotransmitter Dopamine and has potent stimulating effect on the CNS producing a sense of Euphoria and increased energy .Excessive dosage leads to hallucination. Smoking -Tobacco is smoked, chewed or used as a snuff. - Contains large amounts of chemical substance including nicotine which is an alkaloid. - It stimulates the adrenal gland to release adrenaline and non adrenaline into blood circulation, both of which raise blood pressure and increase heart rate. -Smoking increases the incidence of lung cancer. It also affects urinary bladder and throat causing bronchitis, emphysema, coronary heart diseases and gastric ulcers. -Tobacco chewing increases the risk of cancer of oral cavity. - Smoking increases CO content in the blood and therefore reduces the content of haem -bound oxygen. This causes oxygen deficiency in the body leading to anemia. -An addict usually requires counseling and medical help to get rid of habit. 8.5.2: Adolescence and Drug/Alcohol abuse: Adolescence is a period during which an individual reaches reproductive maturity. It is a link between childhood and adulthood. It is a period where there is emotional and behavioral growth of the individual. It is therefore characterized by several physiological and psychological changes. Therefore, during this period an individual is highly vulnerable. Youngsters are motivated towards drugs and alcohol use due to: • Curiosity • Need for adventure • Experimentation • Perceived benefits of alcohol and drug use • Stress and academic pressure • Need to appear cool/peer pressure • Influence of popular media • Unstable family structure 8.5.2: Addiction and Dependence: Addiction: Addiction is a psychological attachment to certain effects such as euphoria and a temporary feeling of well-being usually associated with drugs and alcohol. With repeated use of drugs, the tolerance level of the receptors present in our body increases. As a result the receptors respond only to higher doses of drugs or alcohol. This leads to greater intake and more addiction Dependence: Dependence is the tendency of the body to manifest a characteristic and unpleasant withdrawal syndrome if regular dose of drugs/alcohol is abruptly discontinued. This is typically manifested as nausea, anxiety shakiness and sweating. These may be relieved when use is resumed again. In some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be severe and even life threatening and the person may need medical supervision. Dependence causes the patient to ignore all social norms just so as to get sufficient funds to satiate his/her needs. These result in many social problems. 12 ","8.5.3: Effects of Drug/Alcohol Abuse -reckless behavior -Vandalism and violence. -Excessive doses of drugs may lead to coma and death due to respiratory failure, heart failure or cerebral hemorrhage. -Intravenous intake of drugs could lead to increases susceptibility to diseases like AIDS, Hepatitis, etc. -Damage to nervous system and Liver cirrhosis -Adverse effect on foetus due to consumption during pregnancy -Side effects of performance enhancing drugs for sports: -In females: masculinization, increased aggressiveness, mood swings, depression, abnormal menstrual cycle, excessive facial and body hair, enlargement of clitoris and deepening of voice -In males: acne, aggressiveness, mood swings, depression, reduction in testicles, decreased sperm production, kidney and liver dysfunction, breast enlargement, premature baldness, enlargement of the prostate Common warning signs of drug and alcohol abuse - Drop in academic performance -unexplained absence from school/college -lack of interest in personal hygiene -withdrawal, isolation, depression, fatigue, aggressive and rebellious behavior - deteriorating relationships with family and friends -loss of interest in hobbies - Change in sleeping and eating habits - Fluctuations in weight, appetite, etc. - Stealing to get money to buy drugs/alcohol. 8.5.4: Prevention and Control 1. Avoid undue peer pressure 2. Education and counselling 3. Seeking help from parents and peers 4. Looking for danger signs 5. Seeking professional and medical help 13 ","Strategies for Enhancement in Food Production Food is any substance that is provided in order to meet the body nutritional requirement. Food contain proteins, carbohydrates and fats. With the increase in population, enhancement of food production becomes a primary issue. Plant breeding and animal husbandry are major efforts to enhance the food production and to meet the requirements of increasing population. Animal breeding A significant aspect of animal husbandry deals with breeding of animals. It aims to increase the yield of the animals and introduction of desirable trait into the animal. The word breed is defined as group of animals that are related by features, size configuration, general appearance etc. Breeding between the animals of the same breed is known as inbreeding and breeding between animals of different breed is known as outbreeding. Fig.1. Steps of breeding program Inbreeding occurs between members of closely related individuals within the same breed for about 4 to 6 generations. Males and females with superior traits are identified and mated in pairs. Generally it is the cow that carried the superior desired trait like increased milk production and superior male is the bull which cane give superior progeny. Inbreeding results in increased homozygosity. This is harmful as it can lead to the expression of harmful recessive allele. Superior traits can be eliminated. Continued inbreeding leads to inbreeding depression . Inbreeding depression is the loss in desired traits due to successive inbreeding. This affects both productivity and fertility. 1 Chapter 9 ","Fig.2. Inbreeding leads to homozygosity Outbreeding is the breeding among the unrelated animals. Animals are chosen such that they do not have common ancestors for 5 to 6 generations. Cross- breeding involves breeding between superior male of one breed and superior female of another breed. Desired trait can be obtained through cross-breeding. The animals or the offspring obtained is known as hybrid. The animal produce has both the desired trait from both the parents. Fig.3. Difference between inbreeding and outbreeding Interspecific hybridization involves mating between two unrelated animals. Two different related species can be used for interspecific hybridization. Progeny will get desirable trait from both the parents. 2 ","Artificial insemination and multiple ovulation embryo transfer technology For controlled breeding experiments artificial insemination is carried out. The semen collected from the male parent and allowed to inject in the female reproductive tract of the selected female by the breeder. The semen can be stored or kept freeze and can also be transported for injection into the required female animal. The one of the disadvantage of artificial insemination is that the success rate is low. To improve the success rate, multiple ovulation embryo transfer technology (MOET) came into picture. This is hormonal based technology where female animal is injected with FSH-like hormone to induce follicular maturation and super ovulation (more than one egg). This technology has been demonstrated for cattle, sheep, rabbits, buffaloes, mares, etc. Using this method breeds of females that are high yielding for milk and bullas yielding high quality meat (lean meat with less lipid) have been bred successfully. This helps to increase the number of organisms in a short time. Fig.4. Main steps of MOET What is Animal husbandry? Agriculture practice of breeding and raising the livestock is known as animal husbandry. It is a science of managing and caring of farm animals by human beings. It can also be defined as a practice of raising livestock for promoting desirable traits in animals for human welfare. It is estimated that more than 70 percent of the world livestock population is in India and China. 3 ","Management of farms and farm animals 1. Poultry farm management Use of domesticated fowl (birds) for food and egg is known as poultry farm management. It includes chickens and ducks and sometimes turkey and geese. During poultry farm management few points should be considered on priority such as proper feed and water, hygiene and health care, proper and safe farm conditions etc. Brooding temperature is also of utmost important. Fig.5. Poultry farm management 2. Dairy farm management The management of animals for the milk and milk products includes the dairy farm management. It includes the management that can improve the quality and yield the milk. Quality of breeds in farm determine the yield of the milk. Good breeds include those which have high yielding potential and resistance to diseases. In order to get the good yielding potential, cattle should be well looked, proper hygiene, food and disease-free environment should be provided. Apart from this, proper storage and transport of milk should also be managed. 4 ","Fig.6. Good dairy practices 3. Bee keeping Apiculture or bee keeping is the maintenance of honey bees for honey and other products such as beeswax, propolis, pollen and royal jelly. The products obtained from apiculture are commercially significant. For example, beeswax is used in cosmetic and medical industries. It is also used as a food additive and for cheese coating. Recently, it has been discovered that venom obtained from honey bees can be used to treat AIDS. It has the potential to kill the HIV virus. Common commercial species of honey bees that are used for apiculture include Apis dorsata (rock bee), Apis indica (Indian bee), Apis florea (little bee) and Apis mellifera (Italian bee). Fig.7. Bee-keeping or apiculture For successful bee keeping, following points can be kept in mind: • Knowledge of nature and habits of bees. • Selection of suitable location the beehives. Ideally should be present sufficiently close to a forage area. 5 ","• Catching and hiving of swarms. • Management of beehives during different seasons. • Handling and collection of honey and of beeswax. 4. Aquaculture/Pisciculture Management of catching, processing as well as selling fishes such as Rohu, Catla, and Hilsa etc. is known as pisciculture. Due to more requirement of fishes’ different methods are employed to promote pisciculture. Aquaculture is defined as growing of aquatic animals and selling them for commercial purpose. There are two types of aquaculture- extensive aquaculture and intensive aquaculture . Extensive aquaculture is done in ocean, natural and man-made lakes, rivers etc. Intensive aquaculture exists in ponds and tanks. Plant breeding Plant breeding is the practice of selecting and breeding specific desired plant species in order to obtain desirable traits such as more yield, pest resistance, herbicide resistance etc. The main steps in breeding the new genetic crop are- • Collection of variability is the root of any breeding programme. It is essential to collect and preserve all the different wild varieties, species and relatives of the cultivated species for effective exploitation of natural genes available in the populations. The entire collection (of plants/seeds) having all the diverse alleles for all genes in a given crop is called germplasm collection . • Evaluation and selection of parents with desirable characteristics. Fig.8. Steps of plant breeding • Desired characters are now cross hybridized among the selected parents. This combine the characters genetically in the progeny. This is a time consuming and tedious process. 6 ","• Selection and testing of superior recombinants. Those plants that contain desired characters are selected. The selection process is crucial to the success of the breeding objective and requires careful scientific evaluation of the progeny. • Testing, release, and commercialization of new cultivars. The newly selected lines are evaluated for their yield and other agronomic traits of quality, disease resistance, etc. The testing of new varieties and cultivars is conducted by growing them in the research fields. Their performance under ideal fertilizer application, irrigation, and other crop management practices is then recorded and analysed. Plant breeding for disease resistance Bacteria, fungi, and virus affect different crop species. Approximately 20-30% of crops are lost due to different pathogens. Plant breeding is used to produce disease resistant plants. To produce disease resistant plants, causative agent, and mode of transmission of the disease should be understood. Methods of breeding for disease resistance Breeding can occur through conventional method such as hybridization and selection. It includes steps such as screening germplasm for resistant gene, hybridization of selected parents, selection and evaluation of the hybrids, testing and release of new varieties. But the conventional method has certain disadvantages such as in terms of few disease resistant genes are known. Mutational breeding It is one of the method of plant breeding that modifies base sequence/nucleotide sequence of a gene to obtain new traits other than those observed in parents. These mutations or changes are introduced in plants either by chemicals or radiations such as X-rays. “For example: Mung bean variety is obtained through mutation. This variety is resistant to yellow mosaic virus”. Breeding to obtain insect or pest resistant variety Insect or pest resistant plants are produced based on different strategies such as- • They are modified in such a way that they become tasteless. So, animals avoid eating these plants. • They produce some toxins that paralyzed the infected insect. • They are modified morphologically such as hairier, pointed leaves, odor etc. Plant breeding has helped to develop several useful and important varieties of certain crop plants such as tobacco, potato, okra. 7 ","Plant breeding for improved food quality Plant breeding is important for improving the quality of food as well as meet the nutritional requirement of food. Diets, especially the plant based diets that lack essential micronutrients increases the chances of diseases, reduce life span and reduce mental abilities. The objective of plant breeding for improved food quality is to improve nutrient content, protein content, oil content, vitamin and mineral content. Biofortification The process by which the nutritional quality of food is enhanced through agronomic practices, conventional plant breeding and modern biotechnology is called biofortification . In 2000, maize hybrids were developed that had twice the amount of the amino acids, lysine and tryptophan, compared to existing maize hybrids. Wheat variety, having a high protein content, Atlas 66, has been used as a donor for improving cultivated wheat. It has been possible to develop an iron-fortified rice variety containing over five times as much iron as in commonly consumed varieties. The Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi has developed several vegetable crops that are rich in vitamins and minerals, e.g., vitamin A enriched carrots, spinach, pumpkin; vitamin C enriched bitter gourd, bathua , mustard, tomato; iron and calcium enriched spinach and bathua and protein enriched beans – broad, lablab, French and garden peas Single cell protein (SCP) It is an alternative source of protein for both animals and humans. Edible unicellular microbes can also be defined as single cell protein. Spirulina is a rich source of protein, minerals, fats, carbohydrates, and vitamins. This is also one of the method of reducing environment pollution. Tissue culture Tissue culture is defined as the capability to develop the whole plant from the part of the plant. This capacity to form whole organism/plant is known as totipotency. For tissue culture, nutrient medium, growth regulators such as auxins, cytokinins are needed. This method of producing large number of plants in a very short span of time is known as micropropagation. It will produce genetically identical plants known as somaclones. Meristem (cells which have a capability of repeated cell division) can be used to grow virus-resistant plants such as banana, sugarcane etc. 8 ","Microbes in Human Welfare Microbes are beneficial as well as detrimental to the welfare of human beings. Microbes are utilized in many ways for human beings as explained below- Microbes in vaccination and antibiotics/microbes in industrial products Microbes are used to synthesize different products that are useful for humans. Beverages and antibiotics are the most common product obtained from microbes. For large scale production and use of microbes in industries, special vessels are used, known as fermenters. Fig.1. Fermenters Fermented beverages are being used from time immemorial such as wine, whisky, brandy etc. Saccharomyces cerevisiae commonly known as brewer’s yeast is the most common microbe used for fermentation. It has been used for fermenting malt based cereals and fruit juices to produce ethanol. Different alcoholic drinks are produced based on type of fermentation and raw material used. Whisky, brandy and rum are produced by distillation of the fermented broth whereas wine and beer are produced through distillation. Antibiotics are chemical substances produced using microbes against any disease-causing microbe. The first antibiotic discovered was Penicillin obtained from mould known as Penicillium notatum . Antibiotics discovered helps in the treatment of different diseases such as Whooping cough, leprosy, diphtheria, plague etc. Fig.2. Some antibiotics produced by different bacteria 1 Chapter 10 ","Microbes were also used for the production of certain chemicals such as alcohols, enzymes, organic acids etc. For example, Aspergillus niger is used to produce citric acid, Acetobacter aceti is used to produce acetic acid, and Lactobacillus is used to produce lactic acid. Lipase enzyme can also be prepared using microbes. Streptokinase produced by the bacterium Stre ptococcus and modified by genetic engineering is used as a ‘clot buster’ for removing clots from the blood vessels of patients who have undergone myocardial infarction leading to heart attack. An immunosuppressive agent known as cyclosporin A, is obtained from the fungus known as Trichoderma polysporum is used during organ transplant. Microbes in household products Lactobacillus is a bacterium that is found in curd. It is responsible for conversion of milk into curd. This bacterium produces lactic acid that partially digest milk protein and coagulate it to form curd. A small inoculum of curd is needed in milk to begin the process of formation of curd. The curd is rich in Vitamin B12. The process of formation of alcohol from sugar is known as fermentation. It is a process that occurs in absence of oxygen. So, it is an anaerobic process. Louis Pasteur discovered the process of fermentation. The dough used in making of food items such as idli, dosa, etc. is also formed by the action of bacteria. Bacteria cause fermentation of the dough to form the final batter. The dough is puffed-up due to production of carbon-dioxide. The bread is also formed by fermentation. The dough is fermented by a yeast known as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Many different drinks are being produced by the same process of fermentation. Cheese is produced by Propionibacterium sharmanii which is a fermenting bacteria . This bacterium is used to prepare Swiss cheese. The ‘Roquefort cheese’ are ripened by growing a specific fungus on them, which g ives them a particular flavor. Different varieties of the cheese are known based on their texture, taste, and flavor. These characteristics are based on different microbes used. Microbes in Sewage treatment A major component of this waste water is human excreta. This municipal waste-water is also called sewage. It contains large amounts of organic matter and microbes. The excreta are very harmful, so it should be treated before to be released to minimize the pollution. Heterotrophic bacteria naturally present in waste water is used to treat the sewage. It occurs in two stages- primary treatment and secondary treatment. 2 ","Fig.3. Sewage treatment steps Primary treatment- physical removal of small and large particles through filtration and sedimentation begins the process of primary treatment. Firstly, sequential filtration removes debris. Then sedimentation removes the soil and small pebbles. The left over known as effluent is taken for secondary treatment. Secondary treatment - effluent is transferred through the aeration tanks with continuous aeration. Aeration allows vigorous growth of aerobic microbes that help in aerobic breakdown of organic matter. The aerobic microbes form flocs. Flocs are masses of bacteria associated with fungal filaments to form mesh like structures. This reduces the biological oxygen demand (BOD). Once the BOD of the sewage is reduced, it is passed into settling tank where the bacterial flocs are allowed to sediment. This sediment is known as activated sludge. Then the small part of activated sludge is pump back into aeration tank to serve as inoculum. The remaining major part of the sludge is pumped into large tanks called anaerobic sludge digesters. During this process, different gases are produced such as carbon-dioxide, methane and hydrogen sulphide. Now the waste can be discharged into rivers, streams etc. The Ministry of Environment and Forests has initiated Ganga Action Plan and Yamuna Action Plan to save these major rivers of our country from pollution. One of the major proposals discussed in these plans is to build a large number of sewage treatment plants so that only treated sewage may be discharged in the rivers. Microbes in gobar gas formation Biogas is a mixture of different gases; methane percentage is highest. Some bacteria, which grow anaerobically on cellulosic material, produce large amount of methane along with CO 2 and H 2 . These bacteria which produce methane as a result of anaerobic respiration are collectively called methanogens. Methanobacterium is an example of a methanogenic bacteria. 3 ","Fig.4. Gobar gas production Microbes as biocontrol agents Biocontrol is defined as use of biological methods to control plant diseases and pests. Conventionally, pesticides and insecticides are being used for the control of diseases and pests. But these chemicals are extremely toxic and harmful. Biological control of pests and diseases. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a bacterium that is used as a biocontrol agent against insects/pests. It produces an endotoxin that paralyzes the gut of the insect/pest that consumes it. Bt cotton is an example of such plant produced Trichoderma is a fungus used in controlling plant pathogens. Baculoviruses are also used to attack insects and arthropods. Baculoviruses are pathogens of insects and other arthropods. Most of the baculoviruses used as biocontrol agents belong to the genus Nucleopolyhedrovirus . These viruses are an ideal choice for narrow spectrum actions such as for species-specific insecticidal purposes. It has been demonstrated that they have no negative impacts on other organisms like plants, mammals, birds, and fish or even on non-target insects. Some microbes are also used as bio-fertilizers. Rhizobium is a gram-negative bacterium found as an endosymbiont in leguminous plants that helps in nitrogen fixation. 4 ","Fig.5. Different biocontrol agents Microbes in Human body Human body colonize different microbes in different parts of the body such as skin, gut, reproductive tract etc. The most important microbes found in human body are gut microflora. The stomach microflora includes Streptococcus, Staphylococcus etc. These bacteria are able to survive the acidic conditions of the stomach. The intestinal flora belong to Enterobacteriaceae. This flora is helps in the function of digestion and absorption. It increases the efficiency of process of digestion and the utility of the gut. These microbes help the gut in preventing another microbe’s colonization. They also secrete certain substances that are required for the digestion of the food. Viruses are used as a vector for transmission of required gene during recombinant DNA technology. Microbes as biofertilizers The excess use of chemicals and their harmful effect has forced the farmers to switch to organic farming. Organic farming use biofertilizers. Biofertilizers are organisms that enrich the nutrient quality of the soil. Biofertilizers contain bacteria, fungi and cyanobacteria. Rhizobium bacteria is found in leguminous plants such as pea, bean, etc. This bacterium helps in absorption of nitrogen required by the plants. Other bacteria can also fix nitrogen such as Azospirillum and Azotobacter. Fungi when forms a symbiotic relationship with roots of higher plants, it is known as mycorrhiza. Fungus absorbs phosphorous from the soil and passes it to the plant. Cyanobacteria are autotrophic microbes. They are widely distributed in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Many of them can fix atmospheric 5 ","nitrogen, e.g. Anabaena , Nostoc , Oscillatoria, etc. Therefore, cyanobacteria serve as an important biofertilizer especially in paddy fields. Blue green algae also add organic matter to the soil and increase its fertility. 6 ","Biotechnology principles and processes The use of biology to develop technologies and products for the welfare of human beings is known as biotechnology. It has various applications in different fields such as therapeutics, diagnostics, processed food, waste management, energy production, genetically modified crops etc. The European Federation of Biotechnology defines biotechnology as “The integration of natural science and organisms, cells, parts thereof, and molecular analogues for products and services.” 11.1: Principles of Biotechnology The two core techniques that give rise to modern biotechnology are- • Genetic engineering - Genetic engineering is defined as the direct manipulation of DNA and RNA in the genome of an organism. It involves the transfer of new genes to improve the function or trait. The most important technique of genetic engineering is gene cloning. • Maintenance of sterile environment in chemical engineering processes : To grow only the desired microbe. This is important for the manufacturing of antibiotics, vaccines, drugs etc. Basic Principles of Biotechnology: Genetic engineering allows the isolation and introduction of only the desired genes into the organism without introducing the undesirable genes. The steps involved in genetic engineering are: 1. Development of recombinant DNA (rDNA). 2. Cloning of desired gene 3. Transfer of the cloned gene into suitable host organism. ➢ Origin of replication ( ori) : A specific DNA sequence in the chromosome that can initiate DNA replication. The foreign DNA introduced into the host genome has to be linked to the origin of replication in the host chromosome for the gene to be able to multiply. If the foreign gene is not linked to the ori sequence it may not be able to multiply. ➢ Cloning: The process of making multiple identical copies of a template DNA ➢ Plasmid: A circular extra-chromosomal material that is capable of autonomous replication. Plasmids are used as vectors for cloning and expression. Foreign gene is introduced into a plasmid and the plasmid is allowed to multiply. This causes the multiplication of the desired gene. ➢ Antibiotic resistance gene: The gene in certain microorganisms that bestows on them the ability to grow in the presence of the specific antibiotic as the gene gives them resistance. These genes are present on plasmids. These are used as indicators of cloning and transformation. 1 Chapter - 11 ","➢ Restriction Enzymes: They are enzymes that can cut DNA at specific fragments. They are also called as “ molecular scissors ”. The sequences at which they cut the DNA are specific for the restriction enzyme. The y allow the desired gene to be cut and be introduced in specific locations in the vector or host DNA. ➢ Vectors: These are plasmids that are used to multiply and transfer the desired gene from one organism to the next. ➢ Ligase: Enzymes that are responsible for the joining of the desired gene fragment with the host DNA. Ligases function by getting DNA fragments to stick together. ➢ The basic steps in genetic modification of an organism: ▪ Identification of desired DNA fragment ▪ Introduction of desired DNA fragment into suitable host ▪ Maintaining foreign DNA in the host and its transfer to the progeny 11.2: Tools for genetic engineering (Recombinant DNA Technology): Restriction enzymes or molecular scissors are used to cut DNA to be inserted into the vector. These enzymes add methyl group to the DNA, which help in restricting the digestion of their own DNA. They are used to cut DNA fragments with specific recognition sequences. Recognition sequences: The sequence of DNA bases that can be recognized by the restriction enzyme as the site for restriction or cutting. They exist as palindromic sequences. Recognition site for EcoRI There are two types of restriction enzymes- endonucleases and exonucleases . Endonucleases cut the DNA in the middle whereas exonucleases cut at the ends. For example, ECoR1, Hind III, etc. are examples of restriction endonucleases. Restriction enzymes cut at a specific site on DNA known as restriction site . The restriction site is characterized by a specific recognition sequence for the endonuclease. Each restriction endonuclease identifies a specific palindromic nucleotide sequences in DNA. Palindrome in DNA is a sequence of base pairs that are present in the same order on the two strands when orientation of reading is kept same. 2 ","Ligases are the enzyme that joins the two DNA fragments. Presence of sticky ends (similar overhanging sequences due to the action of the same restriction enzyme) helps in ligation. Separation and Isolation of DNA Fragments: The DNA fragments obtained through restriction are separated by a technique called as gel electrophoresis. Gel Electrophoresis: It involves the migration of negatively charged DNA to the positive electrode through a porous polymer gel matrix under the influence of an electric field. The DNA fragments separate or resolve depending on their size 3 ","as well as the pore size of the gel. The smaller DNA fragments are able to migrate farther than the larger DNA fragments. The most common matrix used for DNA electrophoresis is agarose. Agarose is obtained from seaweeds. Visualization: DNA fragments cannot be directly observed. To observe the DNA fragments they need to be first stained with a compound called as ethidium bromide (EtBr) and then placed in UV light. DNA stained with EtBr fluoresces under UV. Elution: Purification of desired DNA fragments from the gel using various methods is called as elution. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis of DNA Visualization of DNA stained with Ethidium bromide under UV light 4 ","11.2.2: Cloning vectors Vector is any DNA molecule that carries a gene of interest to be inserted into the host organism. For example, plasmid. Plasmid is an autonomously replicating extrachromosomal genetic content present in the bacteria. It is different from the chromosomal DNA. It is used as a vehicle for transfer of gene of interest into the host cell. Plasmid contain origin of replication, site where replication begins when gene of interest enters the host cell. It also contains antibiotic resistance gene. Fig.1. Structure of plasmid Following features are required for a cloning vector • Origin of replication , this is known as ori . This is important for replication within the host cell as well as to maintain the copy number. • Selectable marker to identify transformed cells. Transformation is the process used to introduce piece of DNA into the host cells. The genes encoding resistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, or kanamycin, etc. are some of the useful selectable markers for E. coli. The normal E. coli cells do not show any resistance against any of these antibiotics. • There should be cloning site in the cloning vector. Presence of more than one recognition site can complicate the cloning, so single cloning site is preferable. The ligation of the foreign DNA usually occurs at the site of antibiotic resistance gene. Once of the gene of interest gets inserted at the site of antibiotic resistance gene, antibiotic resistance will be lost. So, a recombinant plasmid will lose antibiotic resistance. So, recombinants can be selected from the non-recombinants. Another method to find out the transformed cells is insertional inactivation. This is based on the ability to produce color in the presence of a chromogenic substrate. For this technique, a recombinant DNA is inserted within the coding sequence of an enzyme, β -galactosidase. Beta-galactosidase converts galactose into lactose. If a gene is inserted into this region, β -galactosidase will not be formed and 5 ","therefore galactose will not be converted into lactose. This results in the inactivation of the enzyme. This is called as insertional inactivation. The presence of a chromogenic substrate causes non-transformed colonies to give blue colour. Presence of gene of interest results in the insertional inactivation of the galactosidase and the colonies therefore, do not produce any color. These colonies can be inferred as recombinant colonies. Fig.2. Blue white screening Insertional inactivation: The inactivation of an enzyme due to the insertion of gene of interest in the region of DNA coding for the enzyme. ▪ Vectors for cloning in plants: Agrobacterium tumefaciens , a pathogen of several dicot plants is used as a vector for plants. It can deliver a piece of DNA known as ‘T -DNA’ to transform normal plant cells into a tumor and direct these tumor cells to produce the chemicals required by the pathogen. Gene of interest is inserted into T-DNA to transform plant cells with required gene. The tumor inducing (Ti) plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens has now been modified into a cloning vector which is no more 6 ","pathogenic to the plants. Cytokinin and auxin coding genes in plasmid acts as growth regulator. Opine catabolism gene codes for energy source. Right and left border are needed to transfer T-DNA into the required host plant cell. Fig.3. Structure of T-DNA Similarly retroviruses have been modified to act as vectors for animal cells. 11.2.3: Competent host In order to allow bacterial cells to take up the DNA, bacterial cell should be made competent. This can be done by treating the cells with specific concentration of divalent ions such as calcium ions, which creates pores in the cell wall of the bacteria. Such bacteria are subjected to heat shock. In this method the calcium treated competent cells are kept in ice. They are then briefly incubated at 42◦C for 1 -2 minutes and then immediately placed in ice. This forces the rDNA into the competent cell. Apart from this, DNA can be inserted into host cells using biolistics, microinjection, gene gun etc. Using microinjection , DNA can be directly inserted into the nucleus of the host cell. A high velocity microparticles of gold or tungsten coated with DNA is methodology used in biolistics . 11.3: Process of recombinant DNA technology There are several steps involved in the process of recombinant DNA technology. 1. Isolation of the genetic material : To isolate the DNA, membranes needs to be broken down. Cells can be treated with lysozyme (in case of bacteria), cellulase (in case of plant cells), and chitinase (in case of fungus). Ribonucleases are used to remove the RNA whereas proteases are used to remove the proteins. After this, the pure DNA can be obtained through precipitation via ethanol. DNA is then obtained as fine threads in suspension. 7 ","2. Restriction digestion of the isolated DNA : Agarose gel electrophoresis is used to check the progression of restriction digestion of the DNA. The gene of interest is now inserted into specific vector and joined via enzyme known as ligase. This forms a recombinant DNA molecule. 3. Amplification of gene of interest using PCR : Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to amplify the target gene of interest. For this two sets of primers- forward primer and reverse primer is used. DNA polymerase enzyme is used to amplify the DNA. The most common polymerase used during PCR is Taq polymerase. 4. Insertion of recombinant DNA is into host cell or organism : Recipient cell is made competent to take up the recombinant DNA. 5. Expression of desired protein: The ultimate goal of recombinant DNA technology is to obtain desired protein of interest. The protein obtained is known as recombinant protein. 8 ","Fig.3. Steps of recombinant DNA technology To produce large quantities of recombinant protein, large vessels known as bioreactors are used. A bioreactor provides the optimal conditions for achieving the desired product by providing optimum growth conditions (temperature, pH, substrate, salts, vitamins, oxygen). Basic parts of a bioreactor: 1. Agitator 2. Oxygen Control system 3. Foam control system 4. Temperature control 5. pH control 6. Sampling port 7. Inlet 8. Outlet Bioreactors are mainly of two types: Stirred type and the sparger type 9 ","Stirring type bioreactor: A stirrer is fixed to a bioreactor having a curved base to facilitate better mixing of the contents. It also improves aeration of the medium. Sparger type bioreactor: In this air is bubbled into the bioreactor from the base of the bioreactor. This bubbling of air results in mixing as well as aeration of the contents. 11.3.6: Downstream Processing The processes and methods involved in the separation and purification of the desired product are called as downstream processing. In case of drugs, the product needs to be suitably formulated and drug tested before being made available commercially. 10 ","Biotechnology and its applications Biotechnology The use of biology to develop technologies and products for the welfare of human beings is known as biotechnology. It has various applications in different fields such as therapeutics, diagnostics, processed food, waste management, energy production, genetically modified crops etc. Fig.1. Different applications of biotechnology Biotechnological application in agriculture Biotechnology has different application in agriculture. It can be used in agro-chemicals, organic agriculture, and genetically engineered crop-based agriculture. It can be used to produce genetically modified organisms. Genetically modified organisms (GMO) can be obtained by alteration in their genetic material. Different application of genetically modified organisms is- • Production of crops which are resistant to abiotic factors such as heat, cold, etc. • Pest-resistant crops. • Help to reduce post-harvest losses. • Minerals can be used efficiently by the plants. • Food with enhanced nutritional values. 1 Chapter - 12 ","The most important application in the field of biotechnology is the formation of pest resistant plants. Bacillus thuringiensis is a bacterium that produces a Bt toxin which has insecticidal activity. Gene that codes for Bt toxin can be isolated and inserted into the plant to provide insect or pest resistance. Bt cotton : Bacillus thuringiensis produces certain proteins that can kill insects such as lepidopterans, coleopterans, and dipterans. They produce insecticidal protein, which when enter the body of the insect will become active. This toxin when binds to the midgut produces causes cell to swell and eventually death of the insect. These Bt genes are isolated and inserted into cotton plants. Such cotton is known as Bt cotton. The gene that codes for insecticidal protein is known as cryIAc and cryIIAc. Fig.2. Bt cotton Pest resistant plants Various pests affect the plants which causes loss as well as decrease in the yield of the plant. A nematode Meloidegyne incognitia infects the roots of tobacco plants and causes a decrease in the yield of the plant. To prevent this, RNA interference technology was used. This method involves silencing of a specific mRNA due to a complementary dsRNA molecule. This inhibits the translation of the mRNA. 2 ","Fig.3. Development of pesticide resistant plants Biotechnology applications in medicine Biotechnology has contributed a lot in medicine industry. The use of biotechnology in medicine is known as medicinal biotechnology. They provide methods for the formation of genetically modified insulin known as humulin . This helps in treatment of large number of diabetes patients. Earlier insulin was extracted from the pancreas of the slaughtered animals such as cattle and pigs. Such insulin has chances to cause allergies to humans. The most important issue with the production of insulin is formation of mature and assembled insulin. Fig.4. Human insulin production 3 ","Gene therapy To correct the heredity diseases, gene therapy is used. The correction of gene defects is known as gene therapy. A normal gene is inserted into the individual or in an embryo to replace the abnormal gene. The first gene therapy was given to a 4-year-old girl in 1990 for Adenosine deaminase deficiency. Earlier, bone marrow transplantation and enzyme replacement therapy were used to treat adenosine deaminase deficiency. But both strategies are not completely curative. Fig.5. Gene therapy Molecular diagnosis It helps in disease diagnosis by various techniques such as ELISA, PCR, and recombinant DNA technology. ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) is based on antigen and antibody reaction to detect different diseases. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is technique to amplify specific DNA segment. This helps to detect HIV in AIDS patients. Transgenic animals Animals that have their DNA manipulated are known as transgenic animals. For example, rats, rabbits, pigs, sheep etc. These animals help to understand how genes are regulated and how they help in development of animals. It helps to study how genes are responsible for the development of various diseases. They can be used to manufacture chemicals that are useful. They can also be used for testing of drugs and vaccines. 4 ","Fig.6. Formation of transgenic animals Biotechnology in production of antibiotics Plants are used to develop antibiotics for humans as well as for animal use. It helps in production of antibiotics, vaccines and artificial hormones for hormone therapies. Ethical Issues: 1. The manipulation of living organisms by man is similar to man “playing God”. It is a tool with great power and therefore, immense responsibility. 2. The genetic modification of any organism is not always completely predictable. It may lead to problems in the organism. 3. The impact of introduction of a GMO into an ecosystem is not completely known. It could have unpredictable results. GEAC: Genetic Engineering Approval Committee is a committee set up by the Indian Government to oversee all decisions regarding GM research and the safety of GMOs for public use. Biopiracy: Use of bio-resources by commercial and multinational companies and other organizations without the appropriate authorization and permission from the countries and people concerned without making the compensatory payment. 5 ","ORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS ORGANISM AND ITS ENVIRONMENT Ecology is the branch of science that deals with the relationship between the organism and the environment. There are different levels of organization, such as- • Organism- each individual of the species. • Population- it is defined as group of organisms that can interbreed. • Communities- different population combine to form communities. • Biomes-large unit of flora and fauna in a specific climatic zone. Fig.1. Levels of organization Major Biomes in India Tropical Rain Forest Biome Deciduous Forest Biome 1 Chapter 13 ","Desert Biome Sea coast Biome Major abiotic factor Temperature is the most important abiotic factor that affects the organism as well as the environment. Average temperature decreases as we move from the equator towards the poles. It ranges from subzero levels in polar areas and high altitudes to >500C in tropical deserts in summer. Temperature affects the physiology of the body as it affects enzyme kinetics and therefore the basal metabolism rate. Some organisms can tolerate wide range of temperature, they are known as eurythermal . E.g., cat, dog, red algae, etc. But vast majority of organisms are restricted to narrow range of temperature, they are known as stenothermal . E.g., crocodile, python, penguin Tolerance of temperature determines the geographical distribution of the species. Fig.2. Different abiotic factors Water is another important abiotic factor. Though life originated in water some parts such as deserts have limited supply of water. So only organisms that have special adaptation can survive.  The productivity and distribution of plants is also heavily dependent on water. For aquatic organisms, pH and composition of water is very important. Some organisms can 2 ","tolerate wide range of salinity, they are known as euryhaline like the molly fish and the green crab. Some can tolerate only a narrow range of salinity, they are known as stenohaline like goldfish, haddock, etc.  Many freshwater animals cannot live for long in sea water and vice versa as each is adapted to their respective osmotic environment. Light is very important for photosynthesis and is another important abiotic factor. The importance of photosynthesis can be well understood in autotrophs. Some species can survive well in low light conditions but some need light of high intensity. Based on required light, plants are divided into short day plants and long day plants. Sun is the source of light on earth.  Even in animals the diurnal and seasonal variation in light affects their functions as light is the cue for their activities like reproduction, migration and foraging. The spectral quality of solar radiation is also important for life. The UV component of the spectrum is harmful to many organisms while not all the color components of the visible spectrum are available for marine plants living at different depths of the ocean. Soil is another important abiotic factor that affects the organism and population. The nature and properties of soil are dependent on the climate, the weathering process, on weather soil is transported or sedimentary and how soil development occurred. Apart from this, other parameters such as pH, mineral composition and topography determine the vegetation in any area. This in turn dictates the type of animals that can be supported. Responses to Abiotic Factors Organisms have different responses towards different abiotic factors. The different responses to abiotic factors can be described as follows: • Regulators : Organisms with the ability to maintain homeostasis. This is achieved by physiological means. This ensures constant body temperature, constant osmotic concentration, etc. All birds and mammals, and a very few lower vertebrate and invertebrate species are capable of homeostasis and regulation. Other organism cannot regulate their body homeostasis. Humans maintain a constant body temperature of 37 0 C. In summer, when outside temperature is more than our body temperature, we sweat abundantly. The resulting evaporative cooling, similar to what happens with a desert cooler in operation, brings down the body temperature. In winter when the temperature is much lower than 37 0 C, our body tries to raise body heat by shivering of the muscles. Plants do not have such mechanisms to maintain internal temperatures. 3 ","Fig.3. Diagrammatic representation of organismic response • Conformers are the organisms which cannot regulate their body temperature. There is an advantage of constant body temperature. Thermoregulation is an energetic process. Heat loss or heat gain is a function of surface area. Small animals have large surface to volume ratio, so they can lose body heat very fast. That is why polar regions do not have small animals. During the course of evolution, the costs and benefits of maintaining homeostasis are taken into consideration. • Partial regulators: Those species that have evolved the ability to regulate but only over a limited range of environmental conditions. Beyond this they simply conform. • Some organism moves temporarily from the stressful habitat to friendlier place. This is known as migration . Every winter the famous Keoladeo National Park (Bharatpur) in Rajasthan host thousands of migratory birds coming from Siberia and other extremely cold northern regions. • Some organisms suspend their growth and functions during unfavorable conditions. Bacteria, fungi and some lower plants form thick walled spores to survive unfavorable conditions. During winter, animals undergo hibernation (winter sleep) and in summer, aestivation (summer sleep). Adaptations Adaptation is defined as any attribute of an organism that enables the organism to survive and reproduce in its habitat. Adaptation is genetically fixed. Organisms adapt themselves according to the environment. For example, desert plants have thick cuticle, sunken stomata to minimize the transpiration. They photosynthesize using CAM pathway. Some plants such as Opuntia have reduced leaves into spines. Physiological adaptation is also present in living organisms. For example, some people exhibit altitude sickness. They have symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, and heart palpitations. But after some time, they acclimatized according to the prevailing conditions. The body also compensates by producing more red blood cells, decreasing binding affinity of oxygen with hemoglobin, and by increasing breathing rate. Some organisms show behavioral responses to cope with variations in their environment. 4 ","Populations Population attributes Population is defined as group of individuals of a species that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. A population has certain attributes. A population may have death rate or birth rate. Increase in population per capita is known as birth rate whereas decrease in population is known as death rate . Another attribute of population is known as sex ratio. Age distribution is also an attribute of population. Age distribution is presented in the form of age pyramid. The shape of the pyramid reflects the status of the population. The population can be expanding, stable and declining. Expanding population is the characteristics of growing population where number of young individuals are more than the old individuals. When the young and old individuals are equal, it is known as stable population . When old individuals are more compare to young individuals, then the population is said to be declining . Fig.4. Representation of age pyramids for human population Population growth The size of the population for any species is not static. It changes according to food availability, predation pressure and adverse weather. Population density changes because of the four main reasons- • Natality is defined as number of births in a given period of time. • Mortality is defined as number of deaths in a given period of time. • Immigration is defined as when the number of individuals of the same species have come into the habitat for a period of time. • Emigration is defined as when the number of individuals of the same species move to somewhere else for a period of time. 5 ","Fig.5. Population attributes that affects population density Population density represented by N, is given as- N is the population density at time t, B+I represent birth rate and immigration, D+E represents death rate and emigration. Growth models • Exponential growth Exponential growth is observed when the nutrients are available in excess quantity. If in a population of size N, the birth rates (not total number but per capita births) are represented as b and death rates (again, per capita death rates) as d , then the increase or decrease in N during a unit time period t (dN/dt) will be- dN/dt = (b – d) × N Let (b – d) = r, then dN/dt = rN 6 ","Fig.6. Exponential growth The r in this equation is called the ‘intrinsic rate of natural increase. The exponential or the geometric growth pattern of population results in J-shaped curve. The final equation obtained is given as- N t = N 0 e rt N t = Population density after time t N 0 = Population density at time zero r = intrinsic rate of natural increase e = the base of natural logarithms • Logistic growth When the resources are limited, then the population growth curve is logistic in nature. When the resources are limited, competition between the individuals occurs. When growing in limited resources, a population initially goes through lag phase, followed by phases of exponential growth and deceleration and finally asymptote. Fig.7. Logistic growth curve The curve obtained is sigmoid in shape. This type of population growth is known as Verhulst-Pearl Logistic Growth , given by the following equation- N = Population density at time t r = Intrinsic rate of natural increase K = Carrying capacity 7 ","Population interactions There are two main interaction-interspecific interactions and intraspecific interactions . Intraspecific interaction occurs between the same species whereas interspecific interactions occurs between the different species. Fig.8. Types of population interaction • Predation is an interspecific interaction where predator kills and consumes the prey. This is important interaction to maintain the prey species. For plants, herbivores are predators. Plants have different adaptations to prevent the attack of the predators. Some have thorns for defense. Some plants produce toxic glycosides as defensive agent. Nicotine, caffeine, quinine etc. are the defensive chemicals produced by the plants which are of commercial importance. • Competition can be interspecific as well as intraspecific. Competition occurs between closely related species for food, shelter , etc. It occurs when the resources are limited. Gause’s principle of Competitive Exclusion states that two closely related species competing for the same resources cannot co-exist indefinitely and the competitively inferior one will be eliminated eventually. This may be true if resources are limiting, but not otherwise. • Parasitism is an interaction where one species is dependent on the other species for food. In this relationship, one organism is parasite is benefitted whereas the other organism is harmed. Parasites that feed on the external surface of the host organism are called ectoparasites. Many marine fish are infested with ectoparasitic copepods. Brood parasitism in birds is a fascinating example of parasitism in which the parasitic bird lays its eggs in the nest of its host and lets the host incubate them. • Commensalism is an interaction in which one species benefits the other species is neither harmed nor benefitted. An orchid growing as an epiphyte on a mango branch is an example of commensalism. 8 ","• Mutualism is an interaction where both the species interacting will benefit each other. Lichens and mycorrhiza are most important example of mutualism. Lichens is mutualistic relationship between algae and fungi. Mycorrhiza is relation between the fungi and the roots of the higher plants. • Amensalism is a relationship in which one species is harmed and other interacting species is neither harmed nor benefitted. 9 ","Chapter 14 Ecosystem Ecosystem: Ecosystem is the functional unit of nature in which living organisms interact with each other as well as their surrounding physical environment. Biosphere: Biosphere is a global ecosystem consisting of all local ecosystems on earth. Types of ecosystem: 1. Aquatic ecosystem: Forest, grassland, desert, etc. 2. Terrestrial ecosystem: Pond, lake, wetland, river, estuary, etc. These are the natural ecosystems. Ecosystem can be artificial or man-made like the croplands, aquarium, etc. 14.1: Ecosystem- Structure and Function Biotic Factors: All the living organisms in an ecosystem Abiotic factors: All the non-living factors in an ecosystem like sunlight, humidity, wind, etc. The characteristic physical structure of an ecosystem depends on the interaction of biotic and abiotic factors. Stratification: It is the vertical as well as horizontal distribution of different varieties that occupy different levels. For example, trees occupy top vertical strata or layer of a forest, shrubs the second and herbs and grasses occupy the bottom layers. The following factors are important for an ecosystem to function as a unit. 1. Productivity 2. Decomposition 3. Energy flow 4. Nutrient cycling The function of an ecosystem is the conversion of inorganic into organic material by the following steps: • Use of the radiant energy of the sun by the autotrophs • Consumption of the autotrophs by various heterotrophs • Decomposition and mineralisation of all the dead organic matter to release the nutrients back into the soil for reuse by the autotrophs. • These events are repeated again and again. Energy moves in a unidirectional manner as we move along the trophic levels. Energy dissipates and lost as heat to the environment . Example: Pond ecosystem Abiotic factors : Water with all dissolved inorganic and organic nutrients, soil rich in nutrients at the bottom of the pond, solar input, day-length, temperature and other climatic factors. Biotic Factors : Producers/ autotrophs: Algae, phytoplankton, floating, submerged and marginal plants in the pond. Consumers/ heterotrophs: Zooplankton, free-living and bottom dwelling forms. Decomposers: Fungi, bacteria and flagellates abundant in the bottom of the pond 14.2 Productivity: A constant input of solar energy is the basic requirement for any ecosystem. Primary Production: It is the amount of biomass produced per unit area in a given time period by plants during photosynthesis. It is expressed in terms of weight (g -2 ) or energy (kcal m -2 ). Productivity: It is the rate of biomass production. It is expressed as g -2 yr -1 or kcal m -2 yr -1 . Gross primary productivity (GPP): GPP of an ecosystem is the rate of production of organic matter during photosynthesis. 1 ","Net primary productivity (NPP): Gross primary productivity minus respiration losses (R), is the net primary productivity (NPP). GPP – R = NPP Net primary productivity is the available biomass for the consumption to heterotrophs (herbivores and decomposers). Secondary productivity is defined as the rate of formation of new organic matter by consumers. Primary productivity of an ecosystem depends on the plant species and various environmental factors and therefore, varies from place to place. The annual net primary productivity of the whole biosphere is approximately 170 billion tons (dry weight) of organic matter. Despite occupying nearly 70 per cent of the earth’s surface the productivity of the oceans is only around 55 billion tons. 14.3: Decomposition: Decomposition: Break down of complex organic matter into simpler inorganic substances like carbon dioxide, water and nutrients by the action of decomposers. Detritus: Dead remain of plants and animals such as leaves, barks, flowers, faecal matter of animals, etc. constitute detritus. Detritivores: Organisms that feed on detritus are called detritivores. Earthworm, fungi etc. are examples of detritivores. Steps in Decomposition: 1. Fragmentation 2. Leaching 3. Catabolism 4. Humification 5. Mineralisation Fragmentation: It is the breakdown of detritus into smaller particles by the action of detritivores. Leaching: It is the process by which water soluble nutrients move downwards to the soil horizon and are precipitated as unavailable salts. Catabolism: It is the breakdown of detritus into simple inorganic nutrients by the action of bacterial and fungal enzymes. Humification: It is the formation and continuous deposition of a dark coloured organic amorphous substance called humus . Humus undergoes very slow decomposition and is highly resistant to microbial action. It is colloidal in nature and therefore serves as a reservoir of nutrients. Mineralisation: It is the process by which some microorganisms further breakdown humus to form simple inorganic nutrients. Humification and mineralisation occur in the soil All steps of decomposition occur simultaneously on detritus. 2 ","Decomposition is largely an oxygen-requiring process. • The rate of decomposition depends on the chemical composition of detritus and climatic factors. In a particular climatic condition, decomposition rate is slower if detritus is rich in lignin and chitin, and quicker, if detritus is rich in nitrogen and water-soluble substances like sugars. • The most important climatic factors that regulate decomposition are temperature and soil moisture. They affect the activities of soil microbes. Decomposition is favoured in warm and moist environment. Decomposition is inhibited by low temperature and anaerobiosis. This results in build-up of organic materials . 14.4: Energy Flow: • Sun is the ultimate source of energy for all ecosystems on earth (except for the dep sea hydrothermal ecosystem). • Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR): The solar radiations that can be utilised by plants for photosynthesis. Of all incident solar radiation only 50% is PAR. The plants are able to capture only 2-10% of the PAR and it is this energy that sustains all life on earth. • There is unidirectional flow of energy from the sun to producers and then the consumers. Therefore, all organisms are directly or indirectly dependent on the sun. • All ecosystems follow First and the Second Law of thermodynamics. • First Law of Thermodynamics: The First Law of Thermodynamics states that energy can be converted from one form to another with the interaction of heat, work and internal energy, but it can neither be created nor destroyed, under any circumstances. • The unidirectional flow of energy shows the First law of Thermodynamics as energy from sun converted into chemical energy by the producers which are then utilised by the consumers. Energy is neither created nor destroyed at any level. • Second Law of Thermodynamics: The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the state of entropy of the entire universe, as an isolated system, will always increase over time. The second law also states that the changes in the entropy in the universe can never be negative. • To counteract the universal tendency toward increasing disorderliness ecosystems need a constant supply of energy so as to synthesise the molecules they require. • Energy flow in the ecosystem occurs in the form of food chain. • Food chain: An arrangement of the organisms of an ecological community according to the order of predation in which each uses the next usually lower member as a food source • Producers: All the green plants in the ecosystem that utilise solar energy for photosynthesis. They are always autotrophic. • Consumers: All heterotrophs are directly or indirectly dependent on plants for food and hence they are all called consumers. Depending on their position in the food chain they can be primary, secondary, tertiary or quaternary. • Primary Consumers/herbivores: The organisms that are directly dependent on the producers. In the above food chain, grasshopper is the primary consumer. • Secondary Consumers/Primary carnivores: The organisms that are dependent on the primary consumers. Frog in the above example is a secondary consumer. • Tertiary consumers/Secondary carnivores: The organisms that are dependent on the secondary consumers. • Quaternary Consumers/Tertiary carnivore: The organisms that are dependent on the tertiary consumers. They are usually the top carnivore in a food chain. • A food chain cannot have more than a quaternary consumer as there won’t be enough energy left. 3 ","• The detritus food chain (DFC) starts with dead organic matter. It is consists of decomposers which are heterotrophs and are mainly fungi and bacteria. They breakdown dead organic matter or detritus to meet their energy and nutrient requirements. These are also known as saprotrophs ( sapro: to decompose). They secrete digestive enzymes outside their body to breakdown dead and waste organic materials into simple, inorganic materials. These simpler substances are subsequently absorbed by them . • In an aquatic ecosystem, Grazing Food Chain (GFC) is the major conduit for energy flow. As against this, in a terrestrial ecosystem, a much larger fraction of energy flows through the detritus food chain than through the GFC. • Detritus food chain could be connected with the grazing food chain as follows: some of the organisms of DFC are prey to the GFC animals. Also in a natural ecosystem, some animals like cockroaches, crows, etc., are omnivores. • Food Web: a system of interlocking and interdependent food chains. • Trophic Level: The specific place in the food chain occupied by an organism based on the source of their nutrition or food is called as the trophic level. • First trophic level: Producers occupy the first trophic level. • Second trophic level: The primary consumers • Third trophic level: The secondary consumers • Fourth trophic level: The tertiary consumers • Fifth trophic level: The quaternary consumers • A food chain can have a maximum of five trophic levels as beyond that the amount of energy is insufficient to sustain another consumer. 4 ","• The amount of energy decreases at successive trophic levels. • When an organism dies it is converted into detritus which serves as a source of energy for the decomposers. • Standing crop: The total mass at a trophic level at a given time. It is measured as mass of living organisms (biomass) or the number in a unit area. • Biomass may be expressed as fresh or dry weight. However, use of dry weight is more accurate. • 10 percent Law: This law states that only 10% of energy of a trophic level is transferred to the next level. 14.5: Ecological Pyramids: An ecological pyramid is a representation in a graphical manner of the relationship between different organisms in an ecosystem. Each of the bars of the pyramid represents a specific trophic level as well as their order. The order depends on who eats whom. This represents the flow of energy. The base of each pyramid represents the producers or the first trophic level while the apex represents tertiary or top level consumer. The three commonly studied ecological pyramids are: (a) Pyramid of number (b) Pyramid of biomass and (c) Pyramid of energy 5 ","• Any calculations of energy content, biomass, or numbers must include all organisms at that trophic level. It is not possible to generalise based only a few individuals at any trophic level . • An organism can be a part of more than one food chains and therefore belong to different trophic levels. • The pyramids of energy, biomass and number are upright in most ecosystems. That is, the producers are more in number than the herbivores, the herbivores are more than the carnivores, etc. • Pyramids of number and biomass can be inverted in some cases but the pyramid of energy is always upright. This is because when energy flows from one level to another some amount of energy is always lost as heat. • Ecological pyramids can accommodate only food chains and not food webs. They can also never depict saprotrophs. 6 ","14.6: Ecological Succession: • Ecological succession is the process of change in the species structure of an ecological community over time. The time scale can be decades, or even millions of years after a mass extinction. This change is orderly and sequential, parallel with the changes in the physical environment. • Pioneer Species: The species that invades a bare area • Pioneer Community: The community that invades a bare area • Climax community: A community that is in near equilibrium with the environment. • Sere: A sequence of ecological communities arising in an area from the initial pioneer community to the final climax community • Primary succession : Primary succession is a type of biological and ecological succession of plant life. It occurs in an environment in which new substrate is deposited. This new substrate is devoid of vegetation and other organisms. It also usually lacks soil and organic matter. It occurs in places such land after a lava flow or area left from retreated glacier. • Secondary succession: Secondary succession is a type of biological and ecological succession of plant life which takes place on a habitat that has been previously populated but has since been disturbed or damaged. For example, areas which have been cleared of existing vegetation (due to tree-felling in a woodland or destructive events such as fires). 14.6.1: Succession of plants: • Hydrarch: A succession originates in a water body (aquatic environment) is called Hydrosere or Hydrarch Succession 7 ","• Xerarch: Xerosere is a plant succession that is limited by water availability. It includes the different stages in a xerarch succession. Xerosere originates in extremely dry situations such as sand deserts, sand dunes, salt deserts, rock deserts etc. • In secondary succession the invasion of species depends on the availability of water, conditions of the soil, and the environment. It also depends on whether any seeds or other propagules are present. Since soil is already present, the succession rate is much faster and therefore the climax community is attained sooner. • Succession always proceeds towards the mesic community. 14.7: Nutrient Cycling: • The movement of nutrients through the various components of an ecosystem is called nutrient cycling. It is also called as biogeochemical cycles (bio: living organism, geo: rocks, air, and water). • Types of nutrient cycles : • (a) Gaseous and (b) sedimentary. 8 ","• Standing state: The total amount of various nutrients like nitrogen, carbon, phosphorus, calcium, etc., present in the soil at any given time, is referred to as the standing state. It varies in different kinds of ecosystems and also on a seasonal basis . • The reservoir for gaseous nutrient cycles (carbon and nitrogen) exists in the atmosphere. • The reservoir for the sedimentary nutrient cycle (sulphur, phosphorus, etc.) exists in the earth’s crust. • Environmental factors regulate the rate of release of nutrients into the atmosphere. • The reservoir functions to meet with the deficit occurring due to imbalance between influx and efflux. 14.7.1: Ecosystem – Carbon Cycle: Most of the chemicals that make up living tissue contain carbon. When organisms die the carbon is recycled so that it can be used by future generations. The movement of carbon through the various components of ecosystem is called as the carbon cycle. 1. Carbon enters the atmosphere as carbon dioxide as a result of respiration and combustion. 2. Carbon dioxide is absorbed by producers for photosynthesis to make carbohydrates . 3. Animals feed on the producers. The food chain causes carbon to move along various trophic levels. Most of the carbon consumed is exhaled as carbon dioxide during respiration. The animals and plants eventually die . 4. The dead organisms are broken down by decomposers. This causes the carbon in their bodies to be returned to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. In some extraordinary conditions decomposition is blocked . The plant and animal material may then be turned to fossil fuel for use in the future for combustion. 5. Marine animals may convert some of the carbon in their diet to calcium carbonate which is then used to make the shells for their bodies. Over time these shells of dead organisms collect on the seabed and form limestone. Due to various activities and movement of earth this limestone may eventually become exposed to the air where it is subjected to weathering. This causes the carbon to be released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide . Volcanic action may also release carbon dioxide. 6. Human activities have significantly influenced carbon cycle. Rapid deforestation and massive burning of fossil fuels have increased the rate of release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. 14.7.2: Phosphorus Cycle: The phosphorus cycle is the process by which phosphorus moves through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Steps in Phosphorus Cycle: 1. Weathering 2. Fertilizer 3. Excretion and Decomposition 4. Dissolved Phosphates 5. Geologic Uplift 9 ","1. Weathering: Weathering of uplifted rocks contributes phosphates to the land. Some phosphates eventually reach the ocean again. 2. Fertilizers: Phosphate fertilizers from fields may run off directly into streams. These may then become part of a soil pool or be absorbed by plants 3. Excretion and decomposition: Excretion by animals (land or in the ocean) and decomposition of both animals and plants release phosphates on land or in water 4. Dissolved phosphates: Dissolved phosphates contribute to forming the ocean sediments by precipitation. Conversion of these sediments into phosphate rocks is a very slow and gradual process. 5. Geological uplift: Geologic forces can slowly lift up phosphate rocks from the ocean floor (the rocks thick with phosphate in them) to form mountains. Difference between carbon cycle and Phosphorus Cycle 14.8: Ecosystem Services: • The products of ecosystem processes are called ecosystem services. • Services of healthy forest ecosystems: ➢ Purification of air and water ➢ Mitigation of droughts and floods ➢ Cycling of nutrients ➢ Generation of fertile soils ➢ Providing habitats to wildlife ➢ Maintenance of biodiversity ➢ Pollination of crops ➢ To provide storage site for carbon ➢ Providing aesthetic, cultural and spiritual values . 10 ","• The average price tag of these ecosystem services are estimated to be US $ 33 trillion annually. • This is nearly twice the value of the global gross national product GNP (US $ 18 trillion). • Out of the total cost of various ecosystem services: ➢ Soil formation accounts for about 50 per cent ➢ Recreation for about 10 percent ➢ Nutrient cycling about 10 per cent. ➢ The cost of climate regulation and habitat for wildlife are about 6 per cent each 11 ","Biodiversity and Conservation • Large and diverse communities of biota occupy distinct climatic zone forming ecosystems. • The term biodiversity was first coined in 1980 by W.G. Rosen. It is the shortened and combined version of two words- “biological” and “diversity”. • Biodiversity or biological diversity can be defined as the vast diversity of species and varieties of all the life forms existing on earth. They include the species of micro-organisms, algae, fungi, plants, animals, occurring on the earth in various habitats and the ecological complexes and niches of which they are a part. • Whether or not a species can survive and colonize an area depends on the environmental conditions of the area as well as the range of tolerance of the species. MAGNITUDE OF BIODIVERSITY • India has approximately 45,000 species of plants and nearly twice as many species of animals. India, therefore, is one of the 12 mega diversity countries of the world. • Numerous species that are yet to be identified are believed inhabit tropics and coral reefs. • The number of species present in tropics can be estimated by comparing species richness between tropics and temperate areas. Inventories are nearly complete for most groups of organisms in the temperate areas. • Scientists have in this manner calculated the total number of species in the world to be approximately 5.50 million. • The most intriguing aspect of biodiversity is that more than 70% of all species are animals while plants account for only 22%. • Among the animals, insects are the most numerous (about 70%) with present estimate of 7 out of 10 animals. • Further the knowledge about protists, archaebacteria and viruses is quite less. With that information the magnitude of biodiversity will further increase. 1 Chapter- 15 ","LEVELS OF BIODIVERSITY 1. Genetic diversity • It is the diversity in the number and type of genes as well as chromosomes present in different species and the variations in the genes and their alleles in the same species. • On average a bacteriophage has 100 genes, Drosophila melanogaster 13000 genes and Homo sapiens 30,000 – 40,000 genes. • Variation in the genes of a species increase with increase in size and environmental parameters of the habitat. • Genetic diversity is useful in adaptation to changes in environmental conditions. • It helps in speciation or evolution of new species. • Lower genetic diversity within a species or variety may be useful for uniformity in yield as well as higher yield. However it is more susceptible to degradation and prone to mass scale destruction at the hands of fungal or insect attacks. 2. Species diversity • It is the diversity and variety in the number and richness of the species of a region. • The number of species per unit area is called species richness . • Number of individuals of different species in a given area represents species evenness or species equitability . • Communities where species are represented by more or less the same number of individuals exhibit evenness. • Communities where one or more species have more individuals than other, show dominance or unevenness . • Species diversity is the product of species richness or evenness or equitability . • Odum et al (1960) calculate species diversity as number of species per thousand individuals while Menhinick (1964) calculates it as number of species in relation to square root of total number of individuals. • Diversity index commonly used in ecological studies is Shannon index . 3. Community and Ecosystem diversity It has three types (i) Alpha diversity (within community diversity) It is a species diversity. α – diversity is dependent upon species richness and evenness. There is a lot of competition, adjustments and inter relationships amongst members of the same community. Variations are limited. (ii) Beta diversity (Between communities diversity). It is diversity which appears along a gradient of habitat within geographical area. Due to differences in microhabitat, niches and in environmental condition there could occur change in communities that could lead to replacement of species. (iii) Gamma diversity . • It is diversity present in ranges of communities as represented by diversity of habitats/ ecosystems over a total landscape geographical area. • Ecosystem diversity is the variety of forms in the ecosystem due to diversity of niches, trophic levels and ecological processes like nutrient recycling, food webs, energy flow, role of dominant species and various biotic interactions. • Diversity helps in achieving more productive and stable ecosystems which can tolerate various environmental stresses like prolonged drought INDIA AS MEGADIVERSITY REGION • India has attained a unique distinction as it has been assigned the status of mega diversity nation. • The country has 10 biogeographical regions. They are: Trans Himalaya, Himalaya, Desert, Semi-arid, Western Ghats, Deccan peninsula, Gangetic Plain, Coasts, North-East and Islands . 2 ","• India has 89 national parks, 492 wild life sanctuaries, 14 biosphere reserves, 6 wetlands and 5 world heritage sites. The country has also 27 tiger reserves. • Deccan peninsula is the largest biogeographical region and the Western ghat and north-east are regions richest in biodiversity. • 33% of flowering plants, 10% of mammals, 36% reptiles, 60% of amphibians and 53% fresh water fish are endemic. The richest regions are the Himalayas, Western Ghats. Indian Islands and North-Eastern Hills PATTERNS OF BIODIVERSITY LATITUDINAL AND ALTITUDINAL GRADIENTS (i) Latitudinal gradient • There is little biodiversity at the poles. Biodiversity is more in temperate areas but is maximum in tropical rain forests. This is because the tropical rain forests have more favourable conditions for more varieties of organisms and with less or no catastrophes. This has allowed for stability in the environment allowing more species to develop. • In temperate areas harsh conditions exist only during the cold season. However, very harsh conditions prevail for most of the year in arctic regions. • Number of vascular species is 118-236/0.1 ha in tropical forests and 21-48 species 0.1 ha in temperate forests. Their number would 10/0.1 ha in arctic regions . (ii) Altitudinal gradient • A decrease in species diversity occurs as we ascend high mountains due to drop in temperature and greater seasonal variability. SPECIES – AREA RELATIONSHIP • German geographer and naturalist Alexander von Humboldt observed that species richness within a region increases with increasing area but only up to a certain limit. • The relationship between species richness and area is a rectangular hyperbola for a wide variety of taxa whether they are birds, bats, fresh water fishes or flowering plants. • On a logarithmic scale it is a straight line. • Here S is species richness, Z is slope of line or regression coefficient, C is y-intercept while A is area. • Regression coefficient is generally 0.1-0.2, regardless of taxonomic group or region e.g. plants in Britain birds in California or mollusks in New York. • However, when the species area relationship is considered for a very large area like whole continent, retrogression coefficient or slope of the line comes to have Z value of 0.6 – 1.2, e.g. frugivorous birds and mammals of tropical forests of different continents with a steeper line of 1.15. 3 ","IMPORTANCE OF BIODIVERSITY 1. Source of food • Of over 3000 species of food plants only 150 species have been commercialized. It can be seen that 85% of the food output is produced by less than 20 species. • Two third of food is being produced by only three crops rich in carbohydrates -wheat, corn (maize) and rice. • Utilisation of more and more food plants has to be made. 2. Source of fats and oils • The major oil seed plants are soybean, coconut, cotton seed, peanut and sunflower, sesame, safflower, mustard and oil palm. • Some newer species of oil are being investigated for obtaining high performing lubricants. E.g. Bitter colocynth, jojoba seed. 3. Fibres The major sources of fibre are cotton, jute, flax, hemp, sun hemp, rosella, coir and agave. Search is continually on for new superior fiber yielding plants. 4. New varieties • Domesticated commercial species are improved for various traits, especially disease resistance by crossing them with wild relatives. • Rice has been made resistant to four main diseases by crossing it with wild species ( Oryza nivara ) from India. • Potato has been made resistant to late blight ( trait from Solanum demissum ), Potato Mosaic Virus Y ( trait from Solanum stoloniferum ), Fusarium and five races of cyst nematodes ( trait from Solanum spegazzini ) 5. Drugs and medicines • A number of drugs are based on plant products. • Rosy periwinkle ( Charanthus roseus = Vinca rosea ) yields alkaloids (Vincristine and vinblastine) which are useful for treatment of leukaemia. The same are now being synthesized chemically. • Other drugs derived from plants are Morphine (Papaver somniferum for pains), quinine (from bark of Cinchona ledgeriana for malaria), taxol (from bark of Yew; Taxus brevifolia and Taxus baccata for treating cancers), reserpine (from Rauvolfia serpentine for treating blood pressure and schizophrenia) etc. • 25% of all drugs are currently sourced from 120 species of plants. • Traditional systems of medicine world over use thousands of local/ wild plants for treating various maladies. It is possible to manufacture innumerable synthetic products from plant chemicals. These are called botano-chemicals. 6. Aesthetic value Biodiversity has a lot of value in terms of aesthetics and attraction of people towards a particular place. Aesthetic value of biodiversity can be utilized for ecotourism, bird watching, wildlife, pet keeping and gardening. 7. Cultural benefits • Historically people have associated themselves with certain specific plants and animals. • Many Indian homes have varieties of Ocimun sanctum (Tulsi) growing in the gardens and pots. • Trees of Ficus religiosa (Peepal) and Prosopis cineraria (Khejri) are considered sacred. They are worshipped. • Many birds are believed to be sacred. Snakes are also worshipped. • Every country and state recognizes a particular plant and particular animal as symbol of national and state pride and cultural heritage. 4 ","8. Ecosystem services • To maintain and utilize products and services of various ecosystems and individual species biodiversity is required. • Forest and oceanic systems control climate and maintain gaseous composition of atmosphere. • Amazon rain forest are considered lungs of planet earth as they give out 28% of total oxygen. • Biodiversity is essential for natural pest control and maintenance of populations of various species. It is also important for pollination by insects and birds, nutrient cycling, conservation and purification of water, formation and protection of soil etc. The services are valued at 16-54 trillion dollars per year. THREATS TO BIODIVERSITY The world is facing accelerated rate of species extinction, largely due to human interference. There are four major causes ( the evil quartet ): i) Habitat loss and fragmentation: - • Overpopulation, urbanisation and industrialization require additional land every year. • It can come through destruction or fragmentation of natural habitat through filling wetlands, ploughing grasslands, cutting down trees, burning a forest and clearing some area of vegetation. • Animals requiring large territories are badly affected. • Migrating animals would go astray and get killed. ii) Over – exploitation:-• Excessive exploitation of a species, whether a plant or animal reduces size of its population so that it becomes vulnerable to extinction. • Three subspecies of Tiger, dodo, stellar sea cow and passenger pigeon have become extinct in the last 500 years due to overexploitation by humans. • Many marine fish populations are declining around the world. iii) Alien species invasions:- • Non-native or alien species are often introduced inadvertently for their economic and other uses. Many times they become invasive and inhibit growth and survival of local species. • Island ecosystems are the most vulnerable. This is mainly because of their small size and small number of species. • Water hyacinth ( Eichhornia crassipes ) was introduced with intent to reduce pollution in Indian waters. • It has led to clogging of water bodies including wetlands at many places. This has resulted in death of several aquatic plants and animals. • Nile perch (a predator fish) was introduced in Lake Victoria of South Africa. It has since then killed and eliminated ecologically unique diversity of over 200 native species of small Cichlid fish. iv) Co-extinctions:- • Certain obligatory mutualistic relationship exist in nature e.g. Yucca moth and Yucca flower. • Extinction of one will automatically cause extinction of other. • If the host fish becomes extinct, all the parasites exclusively found on it will also become extinct. WILDLIFE CONSERVATION Wildlife conservation is necessary for lot of reasons. 5 ","i) Balance of nature: • There is a balance of nature in an ecosystem. The different living organisms live in equilibrium. • The food web consists of an interlocking system of food chain, the destruction of any species of wildlife in an ecosystem can disrupt the entire balance of nature. ii) Commercial value of wildlife : • We have a rich variety of wild life. Government established national parks and sanctuaries attract many tourists from abroad. This is valuable source of foreign exchange. • Surplus animals are exported to foreign zoos and parks, also earning foreign exchange. iii) Biological studies: Naturalists, zoologists and behavior biologists can study the ecology, physiology and behavior of the various forms of wildlife in their natural habitats. This contributes to our knowledge of biology. iv) Sports and recreation: The sport of hunting is restricted to a great extent because of the rapidly declining number of animals.  Good recreation can be provided in form of camping, trekking and other adventure activities by wildlife centres. CONSERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY Conservation of biodiversity is considered under three categories- A. Narrowly utilitarian B. Broadly utilitarian C. Ethical Narrowly utilitarian • Human beings obtain innumerable direct economic benefits from nature. • Food (cereals, pulses, fruits), firewood, fiber, construction material. • Industrial products (tannins, lubricants, dyes, resins, perfumes). • Products of medicinal importance. • Bioprospecting: The process of exploring molecular genetics and species level diversity to obtain and develop products of economic importance. Broadly utilitarian • Amazonian forests alone produce nearly 20% of oxygen during photosynthesis. • Pollinator layer: bees, bumblebees, birds and bat that pollinate the plant without which seed cannot be produced by plants. • Aesthetic pleasure we get from the biodiversity. Ethical: • Humans owe their existence to all other organisms that inhabit and have inhabited this earth. • Each species and variety has an intrinsic value. • It is our ethical responsibility to protect and pass on the biological legacy that we have been blessed with. Conservation of Biodiversity: There are two types of conservation strategies – in situ (on site) and ex situ (off site) 6 ","IN SITU CONSERVATION It is conservation and protection of the whole ecosystem and its biodiversity at all levels in order to protect the threatened species. It is however neither economically feasible nor possible to conserve all existing biological wealth and all the ecosystems. Hot spots These are areas with high density of biodiversity or megadiversity. These are also the most threatened ones. Ecological hot spots are determined by four factors (i) Number of species/ species diversity (ii) Degree of endemism (iii) Degree of threat to habitat due to its degradation and fragmentation (iv) Degree of exploitation: • Mayers (1988) initially identified 12 hot spots with 14% of plant species in an area of only 0.2%. • Today the number of hotspots identified by ecologists is 34 covering an area less than 2% of land surface with about 20% of human population living there. • India has three hot-spots: Indo-Burma, Himalayas and Western ghats and Srilanka . Protected areas • They are ecological / biogeographical area as where biological diversity along with natural and cultural resources is protected, maintained and managed through legal or other effective measures. • They are defined and delimited on the basis of biological diversity e.g. cold desert (Thar), wetland (Assam) saline swampy area (Sundarbans) etc. • Protected areas include national parks, sanctuaries and biosphere reserves. National park • They are areas maintained by government and reserved for betterment of wildlife cultivation. Grazing, forestry and habitat manipulation are not allowed. • There are 89 national parks in India that occupy nearly 1.1% of geographical area Sanctuaries They are tracts of land with or without lakes where wild animals / fauna can take refuge without being hunted. Certain other activities like collection of forest products, harvesting of timber private ownership of land, tilling of land etc., are allowed. Biosphere reserves • They are protected areas which have been designed for multiple purposes. They are meant for preserving genetic diversity in representative ecosystems of various natural biomass and unique biological communities. This is done by protecting wild populations, traditional life style of tribal and domesticated plant and animals genetic resources. • Creation of biosphere reserve was initiated in 1975 under MAB programme of UNESCO. • Till 2002, 408 biosphere reserves had been established in 94 countries. • In India, 17 biosphere reserve have been set up by now. Each biosphere reserve has- 7 ","i) Core or Natural zone: No human activity is allowed. The area is undisturbed and legally protected ecosystem. ii) Buffer zone: It surrounds the core area. Limited human activity is allowed like resource use, strategies research and education. iii) Transition zone: • It is the outermost or peripheral part of biosphere reserve where an active cooperation is present between reserve management and local people for activities like settlements, cropping recreation, forestry and other economic uses without disturbing ecology. • Transition zone has different parts like forestry, agriculture, and tourism and restoration region. • Restoration region is degraded area which is selected for restoration to near natural form. Importance of biosphere reserves includes : i) Restoration – Biosphere reserve help in restoration of degraded ecosystems and habitat. ii) Conservation – They are helpful in conserving genetic resources, species, ecosystems and landscapes without uprooting the local people. iii) Development – They ensure sustainable economic development by maintaining cultural, social and ecological sanctity. iv) Monitoring - Regular monitoring of development and conservation progress. v) Education and Research – Each biosphere reserve supports education and research in various ecological aspects of the ecosystem / biome. There is also exchange of information about research, restoration, conservation and development aspects at the national and global levels. MAB program • Man and biosphere program is an international biological programme of UNESCO which was started in 1971 but was introduced in India in 1986. • MAB has studied impact of human interference and pollution on abiotic and biotic components and develops conservation strategies for present as well as future. EX SITU CONSERVATION • These are means of conservation of any desired species or variety away from their natural habitats. They are offsite collections. • They are live collections of wild and domesticated species in botanical gardens, zoos etc. • Currently, there are more than 1500 botanical gardens and arboreta (gardens with trees and shrubs) with more than 8000 species. • Many of them possess seed banks, tissue culture facilities and other ex-situ technologies. • There are more than 800 zoological parks. • Together they have about 3000 species of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians. • Most of them also have a well-managed captive breeding programmes. • Captive breeding is resorted to in those cases where the number of surviving individuals is so small that there is no realistic chance of in situ survival. • As the number of surviving organisms increases, individuals are selectively released in the wild. • Offsite collection can also be used to restore depleted populations, reintroduce species in the wild and restore degraded habitats. 8 ","Gene Bank These are institutes that maintain stocks of viable seeds (seed banks ), live growing plants (Orchards) , tissue cultures and frozen germplasm with the whole range of genetic variability. (i) Seed banks: Seeds are of two types- orthodox and recalcitrant. Orthodox seeds are those which can tolerate reduction in moisture content (up to 5%), anaerobic conditions and low temperature of -10 o C to -20 o C or even lower for prolonged periods e.g. cereals, legumes. Seeds are allowed to germinate at intervals from plants and thus fresh seeds are developed for storage. Recalcitrant seeds are those seeds which get killed on reduction of moisture and exposure to lower temperature e.g. Tea, cocoa, jackfruit, coconut. They can be stored for shorter duration after treatment with fungicides in room having air and normal oxygen. (ii) Orchards: Plants with recalcitrant seeds are grown in orchards where all possible strains and varieties are maintained e.g. Litchi, oil palm, rubber tree etc. (iii) Tissue culture: It is carried out through callus formation, embryoids, pollen grain culture and shoot tip culture for those plants which are either seedless, have recalcitrant seed, variable seed progeny or where clone is to be maintained. The method is useful in maintaining a large number of genotypes in a small area, rapid multiplication of endangered species and for hybrid rescue. Shoot tip culture can be used to maintain virus free plants. It is used for international exchange of germplasm in cultures multiplied by vegetative methods.e.g. Banana, Potato. Best Test Series for NEET (iv) Cryopreservation : Preservation at -196°C (liquid nitrogen) can maintain tissue culture, embryos, animal cell/tissue, and spermatozoa indefinitely. The cryopreserved material is revived through special technique when required. BIODIVERSITY ACT (2002) For protection of India’s rich biodiversity and associated knowledge against their use by foreign individuals and organizations without sharing the benefits arising out of such use and to check biopiracy. Convention on Biodiversity • “The earth Summit” held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 called upon all nations to take appropriate measures for conservation of biodiversity and sustainable utilization of its benefits. • World Summit on Sustainable development held in 2002 in Johannesburg, South Africa and 190 countries pledged their commitment to achieve by 2010 a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss at global, regional and local level. 9 ","Environmental issues Pollution is any undesirable change in physical, chemical or biological characteristics of air, land, water or soil. Agents that bring about such an undesirable change are called as pollutants. In order to control environmental pollution, the Government of India has passed the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to protect and improve the quality of our environment. Fig.1. Pollution Sources of pollution There are different sources of pollution. They are mentioned below in fig.2. Fig.2. Sources of pollution Air pollution and its control Air pollution is harmful for both plants and animals. Air pollution affects the growth and yield of the crops. They affect the respiratory system of the humans. Particulate and gaseous air pollutants are released from thermal power plants, smelters 1 Chapter 16 ","and other industries. These pollutants are very harmful, they should be filtered out before it should be released into the environment. The most widely used method for the removal of the particulate matter is electrostatic precipitator . Particulate matter if inhaled causes breathing and respiratory symptoms, inflammations, irritations, and premature deaths. Electrostatic Precipitator Fig.3. Air pollution Automobiles are another major cause of atmospheric pollution in metro cities. To prevent the emission of poisonous gases from automobiles, catalytic converters, having expensive metals namely platinum-palladium and rhodium as the catalysts are fitted into automobiles. Use of unleaded petrol or diesel can reduce toxic emissions. The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act came into force in 1981 in India. It was amended in 1987 to include noise as an air pollutant. Controlling Vehicular Air Pollution: A Case Study of Delhi Delhi leads the country in its level of air pollution. Air pollution in Delhi became so severe that a public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in the Supreme Court of India. The supreme court had advised the public vehicles to switch from diesel to 2 ","compressed natural gas (CNG). CNG is preferred because, it is cheap, burns efficiently, very little of it is left unburnt. Other methods were also used to reduce pollution in Delhi such as use of unleaded petrol, phasing out of old vehicles, use of low Sulphur petrol etc. Water pollution and its control With the increase in pollution in water, the government has passed Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 to safeguard our water resources. Domestic sewage and industrial effluents 0.1% percent impurities make domestic sewage unfit for human use. Solids are easy to remove, but dissolved salts such as nitrates, phosphates and other nutrients are difficult to remove. Domestic sewage primarily contains biodegradable organic matter which can be decomposed using microorganisms. Biological oxygen demand can be used to measure amount of biodegradable organic matter in sewage water. Presence of large amounts of nutrients in waters also causes excessive growth of planktonic (free-floating) algae, called an algal bloom which imparts a distinct color to the water bodies. Fig.4. Water pollution 3 ","Biomagnification refers to the increase in concentration of toxicant at successive trophic levels. It occurs because the toxicant itself cannot be digested by an organism and is therefore is passed on to the next trophic level on consumption. Biomagnification of DDT Eutrophication is defined as ageing of the lakes due to nutrient enrichment. A young lake is cold and clear. Nutrients are introduced into the lake from different sources like surface run-off, streams, etc. This increases the fertility of the lake and promotes the growth of aquatic organisms. Over the course of time the lake becomes shallower due to the deposition of silt and organic debris. Warm water plants and marsh plants take over the lake. Slowly the lake is populated by floating plants and eventually the lake is converted to land. Depending on climate, size of the lake and other factors, the natural aging of a lake may span thousands of years. Pollutants from human activities like industrial and domestic effluents can radically accelerate the aging process. This phenomenon has been called Cultural or Accelerated Eutrophication . The pollutants like nitrates and phosphates promote rapid growth of algae. This decreases the amount of dissolved oxygen available to other aquatic organisms. Thus, due to increased water pollution a lake can choke to death. Sources of water pollution There are two sources of water pollution- • Point sources are those sources which arises from single, identifiable source. For example, pipe or ditch. • Non-point sources are those sources that arises from diffuse contaminants from more than one point or source. For example, nutrient run-off from the agriculture land Effects of water pollution • Death of aquatic animals due to depletion of oxygen. • Imbalance of ecosystem. 4 ","• Contaminated water causes various diseases. Polluted water causes some of the deadly diseases like cholera, dysentery, diarrhea, tuberculosis, jaundice, etc. Approximately 80 per cent of diseases associated with stomach in India are caused by polluted water. A Case Study of Integrated Waste Water Treatment Artificial and natural processes are used for the waste water treatment. It involves- • Conventional sedimentation followed by filtering and chlorine treatment. • After the first step, the biologists formed a series of six connected marshes spread over 60 hectares of marshland. Appropriate plants, algae, fungi and bacteria were seeded into this area. They neutralize, absorb and assimilate the pollutants. Hence the water gets purified naturally as it flows through the marshes. Solid wastes Waste from the offices, schools, stores, hospitals constitute the municipal solid wastes. Dumping of these wastes give birth to flies and rats. Sanitary landfills consist of depression or trench where waste is dumped. Waste is categorized as biodegradable, non-biodegradable and recyclable. Biodegradable wastes can be buried in soil and allowed to decompose into harmless by-products. Non-biodegradable wastes cannot be naturally broken down. Their use therefore must be reduced. Recyclable wastes are substances that can be used to retrieve at least few useful substances. Non-biodegradable wastes must be recycled as much as possible. 5 ","Hospital wastes are hazardous. They must be properly incinerated so as to prevent contamination and spread of dangerous pathogens and chemicals. Electronic waste must be recycled to obtain useful metals. In developing countries, this process is still manual. This increases the risk of exposure of the workers towards the toxic substances. Case study of remedy for plastic waste Ahmed Khan, a plastic sack manufacturer in Bangalore developed a solution to the ever-increasing plastic waste. He developed Polyblend . Polyblend is a fine powder made of recycled plastic waste. It can be mixed with bitumen and used for laying roads. This increases the water repellant properties of bitumen and therefore increases the life of the road. Agrochemicals and their effects Use of fertilizers and pesticides has increased manifold for crop production. Overuse of chemical fertilizers causes harm to soil fertility and crop yield. They cause soil, water and air pollution. Case study of organic farming Integrated organic farming is an eco-friendly and cyclical procedure that generates and zero-waste. In this waste products from one process are cycled in as nutrients for other processes. This allows the maximum utilization of resource and increases the efficiency of production. Crop waste can also be used as natural fertilizer in the form of compost. Radioactive wastes Radiations emitted from the nuclear waste is extremely harmful. It affects both plants and animals as it causes mutations. At high doses, nuclear radiation is lethal but at lower doses, it creates various disorders, the most frequent of all being cancer. Therefore, nuclear waste is an extremely potent pollutant and has to be dealt with utmost caution. Green-house effect and global warming Sun rays reaches the earth and warms the earth atmosphere. The earth atmosphere traps the sun rays which increases the temperature of the earth. This is known as greenhouse effect. Carbon-dioxide, methane, nitrous acid, water vapor acts as greenhouse gases. Increase in the concentration of these gases traps more sunlight which raises the earth’s temperature. This is known as global warming. As the temperature is raised, it causes melting of glaciers, changes the weather, oxygen depletion, climate change will affect the food production and agriculture also. Ozone depletion in the stratosphere Ozone is present in the stratosphere which protects the atmosphere from the harmful ultraviolet radiations. Ultraviolet radiations are very harmful for living organisms. They are harmful for DNA and proteins present in the living organisms. Dobson unit is used to measure the thickness of the ozone layer in a column of air from the ground to the top of the atmosphere. 6 ","Oxygen when absorbs ultraviolet rays, it breaks into oxygen atoms. Oxygen atoms when combine with oxygen, they form ozone. The major cause of ozone depletion is a group of chemicals called as chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs) such as Freon. CFCs are used in refrigerators. These CFCs in atmosphere absorbs ultraviolet rays and forms chlorine free radical. Fig.5. Ozone depletion Ozone is depleted due to chlorofluorocarbons which are widely used in refrigerators. Degradation of ozone causes ozone hole. UV radiations that have wavelengths shorter than UV-B are completely absorbed by the atmosphere. UV-B rays are dangerous and damages living organisms. They cause skin cancers, inflammation of cornea, cataract, etc. Recognizing the deleterious effects of ozone depletion, an international treaty, known as the Montreal Protocol, was signed at Montreal (Canada) in 1987 (effective in 1989) to control the emission of ozone depleting substances. Degradation by improper resource utilization and maintenance: Soil erosion and desertification: Fertile top soil takes centuries to form. Soil erosion takes place due to human activities like over-grazing, over-cultivation, deforestation and poor irrigation practices. This leads to loss of top soil and formation of arid land. This will eventually lead to desertification. Rapid urbanization is a major threat to soil integrity. Water logging and soil salinity: Improper drainage of water leads to water logging of the soil. Accumulation of water also causes attraction and dissolution of water soluble salts. These salts are then deposited on the soil surface as a thin crust or collected around the plant roots. Increased soil salinity affects plant growth and damages agriculture. Green revolution has played a major role in increased water logging and soil salinity. Deforestation: 7 ","The complete removal of forest and tree cover due to reckless felling of trees is called deforestation. It is the result of human activities. Causes of deforestation: 1. Conversion of forests to farmlands: Forests are cleared by cutting of trees and burning of stumps. The land is used for cultivation and the ash is used as fertilizer. After cultivation of crops the land is left fallow to allow the soil nutrients to regenerate. With increasing population lands do not get enough time to recover and form forests. 2. Urbanization: Rapid urbanization has led to indiscriminate clearing of forests for various purposes such as agriculture, housing, industrialization, etc. Reforestation: It is the process of restoring forest cover to a place where forests once existed but were cleared off. With sufficient time it can occur naturally. The process can be sped up by human intervention involving planting plants and trees. Case Study of People’s Participation in Conservation of Forests: Bishnoi/Amrita Devi Bishnoi: The Bishnoi community peacefully co-exist with nature. In 1731, a forest nearby their village was ordered to be cleared by the King of Jodhpur. Amrita Devi, her family and around 200 members of her village died protecting the trees. In her honor , the Government of India instituted an award called as “Amrita Devi Bishnoi Wildlife Protection Award ”. This is awarded to individuals or communities that show exemplary courage and dedication in protecting wildlife. Chipko Movement: Local women of Garhwal region in 1974 protected the trees against felling by hugging them. Joint Forest Movement: It is an initiative by Government of India in 1980s. It aims towards the involvement of local communities and people in sustainable development of forests. 8 "]
